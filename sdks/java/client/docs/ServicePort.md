# ServicePort

ServicePort contains information on service's port.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**appProtocol** | **String** | The application protocol for this port. This is used as a hint for implementations to offer richer behavior for protocols that they understand. This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:  * Un-prefixed protocol names - reserved for IANA standard service names (as per RFC-6335 and https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names).  * Kubernetes-defined prefixed names:   * &#39;kubernetes.io/h2c&#39; - HTTP/2 prior knowledge over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#name-starting-http-2-with-prior-   * &#39;kubernetes.io/ws&#39;  - WebSocket over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455   * &#39;kubernetes.io/wss&#39; - WebSocket over TLS as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455  * Other protocols should use implementation-defined prefixed names such as mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol. |  [optional]
**name** | **String** | The name of this port within the service. This must be a DNS_LABEL. All ports within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When considering the endpoints for a Service, this must match the &#39;name&#39; field in the EndpointPort. Optional if only one ServicePort is defined on this service. |  [optional]
**nodePort** | **Integer** | The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort or LoadBalancer.  Usually assigned by the system. If a value is specified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the operation will fail.  If not specified, a port will be allocated if this Service requires one.  If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type from NodePort to ClusterIP).

**port** | **Integer** | The port that will be exposed by this service. | 
**protocol** | **String** | The IP protocol for this port. Supports \&quot;TCP\&quot;, \&quot;UDP\&quot;, and \&quot;SCTP\&quot;. Default is TCP. |  [optional]
**targetPort** | **String** |  |  [optional]
