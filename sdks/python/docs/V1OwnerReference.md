# V1OwnerReference

OwnerReference contains enough information to let you identify an owning object. An owning object must be in the same namespace as the dependent, or be cluster-scoped, so there is no namespace field.
## Properties

**block_owner_deletion** | **bool** | If true, AND if the owner has the \&quot;foregroundDeletion\&quot; finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed.
