ExecAction describes a \"run in container\" action.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**command** | **[str]** | Command is the command line to execute inside the container, the working directory for the command  is root (&#39;/&#39;) in the container&#39;s filesystem. The command is simply exec&#39;d, it is not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions (&#39;|&#39;, etc) won&#39;t work. To use a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell. Exit status of 0 is treated as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy. | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
