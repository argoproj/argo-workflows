# LabelSelector

A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**match_expressions** | [**[LabelSelectorRequirement]**](LabelSelectorRequirement.md) | matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. | [optional] 
**match_labels** | **{str: (str,)}** | matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is \&quot;key\&quot;, the operator is \&quot;In\&quot;, and the values array contains only \&quot;value\&quot;. The requirements are ANDed. | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
