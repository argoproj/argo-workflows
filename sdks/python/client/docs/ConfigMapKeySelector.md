## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**key** | **str** | The key to select. | 
**name** | **str** | Name of the referent. This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are almost certainly wrong. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names | [optional] 
**optional** | **bool** | Specify whether the ConfigMap or its key must be defined | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
