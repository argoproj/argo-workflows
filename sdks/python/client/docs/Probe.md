# Probe

Probe describes a health check to be performed against a container to determine whether it is alive or ready to receive traffic.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**_exec** | [**ExecAction**](ExecAction.md) |  | [optional] 
**failure_threshold** | **int** | Minimum consecutive failures for the probe to be considered failed after having succeeded. Defaults to 3. Minimum value is 1. | [optional] 
**grpc** | [**GRPCAction**](GRPCAction.md) |  | [optional] 
**http_get** | [**HTTPGetAction**](HTTPGetAction.md) |  | [optional] 
**initial_delay_seconds** | **int** | Number of seconds after the container has started before liveness probes are initiated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes | [optional] 
**period_seconds** | **int** | How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. Default to 10 seconds. Minimum value is 1. | [optional] 
**success_threshold** | **int** | Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed. Defaults to 1. Must be 1 for liveness and startup. Minimum value is 1. | [optional] 
**tcp_socket** | [**TCPSocketAction**](TCPSocketAction.md) |  | [optional] 
**termination_grace_period_seconds** | **int** | Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon probe failure. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod&#39;s terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate. Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset. | [optional] 
**timeout_seconds** | **int** | Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults to 1 second. Minimum value is 1. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
