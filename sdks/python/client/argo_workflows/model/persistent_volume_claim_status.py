Valid values are either:  * Un-prefixed keys:   - storage - the capacity of the volume.  * Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as \"example.com/my-custom-resource\" Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are considered reserved and hence may not be used.

Transient errors don't set   NodeResizeFailed. For example: if expanding a PVC for more capacity - this field can be one of the following states:  - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = \"ControllerResizeInProgress\"      - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = \"ControllerResizeFailed\"      - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = \"NodeResizePending\"      - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = \"NodeResizeInProgress\"      - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = \"NodeResizeFailed\" When this field is not set, it means that no resize operation is in progress for the given PVC.

For example - a controller that only is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other valid resources associated with PVC.

Capacity reported here may be larger than the actual capacity when a volume expansion operation is requested. For storage quota, the larger value from allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources is used. If allocatedResources is not set, PVC.spec.resources alone is used for quota calculation. If a volume expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only lowered if there are no expansion operations in progress and if the actual volume capacity is equal or lower than the requested capacity.
