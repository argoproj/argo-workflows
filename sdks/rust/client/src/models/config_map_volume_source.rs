/// ConfigMapVolumeSource : Adapts a ConfigMap into a volume.  The contents of the target ConfigMap's Data field will be presented in a volume as files using the keys in the Data field as the file names, unless the items element is populated with specific mappings of keys to paths. ConfigMap volumes support ownership management and SELinux relabeling.

This might be in conflict with other options that affect the file mode, like fsGroup, and the result can be other mode bits set.
