/**
 * This is a base version of permission definition
 * The system will look at all URL being routed explicitly in /app path
 *
 * This permission mapping is very nascent version as it only looks at user groups to prevent feature access.
 * This is good for now.
 *
 * Based on my discussions with engineers in api team: The group is a very high level property.
 *
 * A 'Group' will be composed of 'Roles'. 'Roles' will be composed of 'permissions' on objects.
 * Eventually we will need to base our permissions framework on the lowest level objects - permissions
 *
 * In future admin might have the capability to define roles and groups in the system. So permissions will
 * be our fundamental level of control on the view layer.
