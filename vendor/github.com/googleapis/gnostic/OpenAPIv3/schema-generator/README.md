# OpenAPI 3.0 Schema Generator

This directory contains a support tool that reads (scrapes) the
Markdown text specification for OpenAPI 3.0 and builds a 
corresponding JSON schema.

It also contains "3.0.md", a local copy of the OpenAPI specification
with modifications that fix minor inconsistencies and make it easier
to read. We hope to have these changes merged into the official 
document.

## Disclaimer

This does not generate the official OpenAPI 3.0 JSON Schema, which 
at the time of this commit, does not exist.
