# API Discovery Format

This directory contains a Protocol Buffer-language model
and related code for supporting Google's API Discovery Format.

Gnostic applications and plugins can use Discovery.proto
to generate Protocol Buffer support code for their preferred languages.

Discovery.go is used by Gnostic to read JSON and YAML Discovery 
descriptions into the Protocol Buffer-based datastructures 
generated from Discovery.proto.

Discovery.proto and Discovery.go are generated by the Gnostic 
compiler generator, and Discovery.pb.go is generated by 
protoc, the Protocol Buffer compiler, and protoc-gen-go, the
Protocol Buffer Go code generation plugin.
