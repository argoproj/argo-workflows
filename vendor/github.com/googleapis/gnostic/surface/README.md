# API Code Surface

This directory contains a Protocol Buffer-language model
suitable for generating support code for calling and
implementing an API.

It can be generated from other formats read by gnostic 
and passed to code generator plugins to assist them by 
providing a preprocessed API description that is easier
to generate.
