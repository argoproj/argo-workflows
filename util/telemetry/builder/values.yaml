      An operation is a single workflow reconciliation loop within the workflow-controller.
      It's the time for the controller to process a single workflow after it has been read from the cluster and is a measure of the performance of the controller affected by the complexity of the workflow.

      This counter tracks pods that were automatically restarted by the [failed pod restart](pod-restarts.md) feature.
      These are infrastructure-level failures (like node eviction) that occur before the main container enters the Running state.
    notes: |
      `reason` will be one of:

      - `NodeShutdown`: Graceful node shutdown
      - `NodeAffinity`: Node affinity/selector no longer matches
      - `UnexpectedAdmissionError`: Unexpected error during pod admission

      `condition` is extracted from the pod status message when available (e.g., `DiskPressure`, `MemoryPressure`).
      It will be empty if the condition cannot be determined.

    notes: |
      This metric ignores the `PodInitializing` reason and does not count it.
      The `reason` attribute is the value from the Reason message before the `:` in the message.
