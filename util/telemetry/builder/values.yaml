      This counter tracks pods that were automatically restarted by the [failed pod restart](pod-restarts.md) feature.
      These are infrastructure-level failures (like node eviction) that occur before the main container enters the Running state.
    notes: |

      - `NodeShutdown`: Graceful node shutdown
      - `NodeAffinity`: Node affinity/selector no longer matches
      - `UnexpectedAdmissionError`: Unexpected error during pod admission

      `condition` is extracted from the pod status message when available (e.g., `DiskPressure`, `MemoryPressure`).
      It will be empty if the condition cannot be determined.
