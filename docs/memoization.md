# Step Level Memoization

> v2.10 and after

## Introduction

Workflows often have outputs that are expensive to compute. 
This feature reduces cost and workflow execution time by memoizing previously run steps: 
it stores the outputs of a template into a specified cache with a variable key.

## Cache Method

Currently, caching can only be performed with ConfigMaps.
This allows you to easily manipulate cache entries manually through `kubectl` and the Kubernetes API without having to go through Argo.  

## Using Memoization 

Memoization is set at the template level. You must specify a key, which can be static strings but more often depend on inputs. 
You must also specify a name for the ConfigMap cache. 

```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
 generateName: memoized-workflow-
spec:
 entrypoint: whalesay
 templates:
    - name: whalesay
      memoize:
        key: "{{inputs.parameters.message}}" 
        cache:
          configMap:
            name: whalesay-cache

...
```
