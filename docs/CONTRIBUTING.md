## How To Contribute

We're always looking for contributors.

### Authoring PRs

* Documentation - something missing or unclear? Please submit a pull request according to our [docs contribution guide](doc-changes.md)!
* Code contribution - investigate a [good first issue](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), [high priority bugs](#triaging-bugs), or anything not assigned.
* You can work on an issue without being assigned.

#### Contributor Workshop

Please check out the following resources if you are interested in contributing:

* [90m hands-on contributor workshop](https://youtu.be/zZv0lNCDG9w).
* [Deep-dive into components and hands-on experiments](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IU0a3unnr3tBRi38Zn3EHQZj3z6yvocfG9x9icRu1LE/edit?usp=sharing).
* [Architecture overview](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/docs/architecture.md).

#### Running Locally

To run Argo Workflows locally for development: [running locally](running-locally.md).

#### Committing

See the [Committing Guidelines](running-locally.md#committing).

#### Dependencies

Dependencies increase the risk of security issues and have on-going maintenance costs.

The dependency must pass these test:

* A strong use case.
* It has an acceptable license (e.g. MIT).
* It is actively maintained.
* It has no security issues.

Example, should we add `fasttemplate`
, [view the Snyk report](https://snyk.io/advisor/golang/github.com/valyala/fasttemplate):

| Test                                    | Outcome                             |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| A strong use case.                      | ‚ùå Fail. We can use `text/template`. |
| It has an acceptable license (e.g. MIT) | ‚úÖ Pass. MIT license.               |
| It is actively maintained.              | ‚ùå Fail. Project is inactive.        |
| It has no security issues.              | ‚úÖ Pass. No known security issues.  |

No, we should not add that dependency.

#### Test Policy

Changes without either unit or e2e tests are unlikely to be accepted.
See [the pull request template](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md).

### Other Contributions

* [Reviewing PRs](#reviewing-prs)
* Responding to questions in the [Slack](#slack) channels
* Responding to questions in [Github Discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/discussions)
* [Triaging new bugs](#triaging-bugs)

#### Reviewing PRs

Anybody can review a PR.
If you are in a [designated role](#roles), add yourself as an "Assignee" to a PR if you plan to lead the review.
If you are a Reviewer or below, then once you have approved a PR, request a review from one or more Approvers and above.

#### Triaging Bugs

New bugs need to be triaged to identify the highest priority ones.
Any Member can triage bugs.

Apply the labels `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, and `P3`, where `P0` is highest priority and needs immediate attention, followed by `P1`, `P2`, and then `P3`.
If there's a new `P0` bug, notify the [`#argo-wf-contributors`](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C0510EUH90V) Slack channel.

Any bugs with >= 5 "üëç" reactions should be labeled at least `P1`.
Any bugs with 3-4 "üëç" reactions should be labeled at least `P2`.
Bugs can be [sorted by "üëç"](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Atype%2Fbug).

If the issue is determined to be a user error and not a bug, remove the `type/bug` label (and the `type/regression` label, if applicable) and replace it with the `type/support` label.
If more information is needed from the author to diagnose the issue, then apply the `problem/more information needed` label.

Please only assign issues to members. New contributors are encouraged to work on a PR directly without being assigned.

##### Staleness

Only issues and PRs that have the [`problem/more information needed` label](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/labels/problem%2Fmore%20information%20needed) will be considered for staleness.

If the author does not respond timely to a request for more information, the issue or PR will be automatically marked with the `problem/stale` label and a bot message.
Subsequently, if there is still no response, it will be automatically closed as "not planned".

See the [Stale Action configuration](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/.github/workflows/stale.yaml) for more details.

## Sustainability Effort

Argo Workflows is seeking more [Reviewers and Approvers](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/blob/main/community/membership.md) to help keep it viable.
Please see [Sustainability Effort](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/community/sustainability_effort.md) for more information.
