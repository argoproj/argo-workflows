### Running Locally

To run Argo Workflows locally for development: [running locally](running-locally.md).

### Committing

See the [Committing Guidelines](running-locally.md#committing).

### Dependencies

Dependencies increase the risk of security issues and have on-going maintenance costs.

The dependency must pass these test:

* A strong use case.
* It has an acceptable license (e.g. MIT).
* It is actively maintained.
* It has no security issues.

Example, should we add `fasttemplate`
, [view the Snyk report](https://snyk.io/advisor/golang/github.com/valyala/fasttemplate):

| Test                                    | Outcome                             |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| A strong use case.                      | ❌ Fail. We can use `text/template`. |
| It has an acceptable license (e.g. MIT) | ✅ Pass. MIT license.               |
| It is actively maintained.              | ❌ Fail. Project is inactive.        |
| It has no security issues.              | ✅ Pass. No known security issues.  |

No, we should not add that dependency.

### Test Policy

Changes without either unit or e2e tests are unlikely to be accepted.
