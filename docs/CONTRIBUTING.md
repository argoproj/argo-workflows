## How To Contribute

We're always looking for contributors.

### Authoring PRs

* Documentation - something missing or unclear? Please submit a pull request!
* Code contribution - investigate
  a [good first issue](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
  , or anything not assigned.
* You can work on an issue without being assigned.
* Most valuable issues are the ones of higher priority. Priority is indicated by a label of `P0`-`P3`, with lower numbers indicating higher priority.

### Other ways to contribute to the project

* Reviewing PRs
* Responding to questions in the [Slack](#slack) channels
* Responding to questions in [Github Discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/discussions)
* Triaging new bugs

#### Triaging Bugs

New bugs need to be triaged to identify the highest priority ones.

Apply the labels `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, and `P3`, where `P0` is highest priority and needs immediate attention, followed by `P1`, `P2`, and then `P3`.
If there's a new `P0` bug, notify the [#argo-wf-contributors](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C0510EUH90V) slack channel.

Any bugs with >= 5 "üëç" reactions should be labeled at least `P1`.
Any bugs with 3-4 "üëç" reactions should be labeled at least `P2`. 
Bugs can be [sorted by "üëç"](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Abug).

If the issue is determined to be a user error and not a bug, remove the `bug` label (and the `regression` label, if applicable) and replace it with the `support` label.
If more information is needed from the author to diagnose the issue, then apply the `more-information-needed` label.


### Roles

The Argo project currently has 4 designated [roles](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/blob/main/community/membership.md):
- Member
- Reviewer
- Approver
- Lead

The Reviewer and Approver roles can optionally be scoped to an area of the codebase (for example, UI or docs).


### Sustainability Effort

Argo Workflows is seeking more [Reviewers and Approvers](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/blob/main/community/membership.md) to help keep it viable.
Please see [Sustainability Effort](sustainability_effort.md) for more information.

### Running Locally

To run Argo Workflows locally for development: [running locally](running-locally.md).

### Committing

See the [Committing Guidelines](running-locally.md#committing).

### Dependencies

Dependencies increase the risk of security issues and have on-going maintenance costs.

The dependency must pass these test:

* A strong use case.
* It has an acceptable license (e.g. MIT).
* It is actively maintained.
* It has no security issues.

Example, should we add `fasttemplate`
, [view the Snyk report](https://snyk.io/advisor/golang/github.com/valyala/fasttemplate):

| Test                                    | Outcome                             |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| A strong use case.                      | ‚ùå Fail. We can use `text/template`. |
| It has an acceptable license (e.g. MIT) | ‚úÖ Pass. MIT license.               |
| It is actively maintained.              | ‚ùå Fail. Project is inactive.        |
| It has no security issues.              | ‚úÖ Pass. No known security issues.  |

No, we should not add that dependency.

### Test Policy

Changes without either unit or e2e tests are unlikely to be accepted.
See [the pull request template](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md).
