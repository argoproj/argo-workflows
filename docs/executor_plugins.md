# Executor Plugins

> Since v3.3

## Configuration

Plugins are disabled by default. To enable them, start the controller with `ARGO_EXECUTOR_PLUGINS=true`, e.g.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: workflow-controller
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: workflow-controller
          env:
            - name: ARGO_EXECUTOR_PLUGINS
              value: "true"
```

When using the [Helm chart](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/tree/master/charts/argo-workflows), add this to your `values.yaml`:

```yaml
controller:
  extraEnv:
    - name: ARGO_EXECUTOR_PLUGINS
      value: "true"
```

## Template Executor

This is a plugin that runs custom "plugin" templates, e.g. for non-pod tasks such as Tekton builds, Spark jobs, sending
Slack notifications.

### A Simple Python Plugin

Let's make a Python plugin that prints "hello" each time the workflow is operated on.

We need the following:

1. Plugins enabled (see above).
2. A HTTP server that will be run as a sidecar to the main container and will respond to RPC HTTP requests from the
   executor with [this API contract](executor_swagger.md).
3. A `plugin.yaml` configuration file, that is turned into a config map so the controller can discover the plugin.

A template executor plugin services HTTP POST requests on `/api/v1/template.execute`:

```shell
curl http://localhost:4355/api/v1/template.execute -d \
'{
  "workflow": {
    "metadata": {
      "name": "my-wf"
    }
  },
  "template": {
    "name": "my-tmpl",
    "inputs": {},
    "outputs": {},
    "plugin": {
      "hello": {}
    }
  }
}'
# ...
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
  "node": {
    "phase": "Succeeded",
    "message": "Hello template!"
  }
}
```

**Tip:** The port number can be anything, but must not conflict with other plugins. Don't use common ports such as 80,
443, 8080, 8081, 8443. If you plan to publish your plugin, choose a random port number under 10,000 and create a PR to
add your plugin. If not, use a port number greater than 10,000.

We'll need to create a script that starts a HTTP server. Save this as `server.py`:

```python
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

with open("/var/run/argo/token") as f:
    token = f.read().strip()


class Plugin(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):

    def args(self):
        return json.loads(self.rfile.read(int(self.headers.get('Content-Length'))))

    def reply(self, reply):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps(reply).encode("UTF-8"))

    def forbidden(self):
        self.send_response(403)
        self.end_headers()

    def unsupported(self):
        self.send_response(404)
        self.end_headers()

    def do_POST(self):
        if self.headers.get("Authorization") != "Bearer " + token:
            self.forbidden()
        elif self.path == '/api/v1/template.execute':
            args = self.args()
            if 'hello' in args['template'].get('plugin', {}):
                self.reply(
                    {'node': {'phase': 'Succeeded', 'message': 'Hello template!',
                              'outputs': {'parameters': [{'name': 'foo', 'value': 'bar'}]}}})
            else:
                self.reply({})
        else:
            self.unsupported()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    httpd = HTTPServer(('', 4355), Plugin)
    httpd.serve_forever()
```

**Tip**: Plugins can be written in any language you can run as a container. Python is convenient because you can embed
the script in the container.

Some things to note here:

* You only need to implement the calls you need. Return 404 and it won't be called again.
* The path is the RPC method name.
* You should check that the `Authorization` header contains the same value as `/var/run/argo/token`. Return 403 if not
* The request body contains the template's input parameters.
* The response body may contain the node's result, including the phase (e.g. "Succeeded" or "Failed") and a message.
* If the response is `{}`, then the plugin is saying it cannot execute the plugin template, e.g. it is a Slack plugin,
  but the template is a Tekton job.
* If the status code is 404, then the plugin will not be called again.
* If you save the file as `server.*`, it will be copied to the sidecar container's `args` field. This is useful for building self-contained plugins in scripting languages like Python or Node.JS.

Next, create a manifest named `plugin.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ExecutorPlugin
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  sidecar:
    container:
      command:
        - python
        - -u # disables output buffering
        - -c
      image: python:alpine3.6
      name: hello-executor-plugin
      ports:
        - containerPort: 4355
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 65534 # nobody
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "64Mi"
          cpu: "250m"
        limits:
          memory: "128Mi"
          cpu: "500m"
```

Build and install as follows:

```shell
argo executor-plugin build .
kubectl -n argo apply -f hello-executor-plugin-configmap.yaml
```

Check your controller logs:

```
level=info msg="Executor plugin added" name=hello-controller-plugin
```

Run this workflow.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: hello-
spec:
  entrypoint: main
  templates:
    - name: main
      plugin:
        hello: { }
```

You'll see the workflow complete successfully.

### Discovery

When a workflow is run, plugins are loaded from:

* The workflow's namespace.
* The Argo installation namespace (typically `argo`).

If two plugins have the same name, only the one in the workflow's namespace is loaded.

### Secrets

If you interact with a third-party system, you'll need access to secrets. Don't put them in `plugin.yaml`. Use a secret:

```yaml
spec:
  sidecar:
    container:
      env:
        - name: URL
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: slack-executor-plugin
              key: URL
```

Refer to the [Kubernetes Secret documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) for secret best practices and security considerations.

### Resources, Security Context

We made these mandatory, so no one can create a plugin that uses an unreasonable amount of memory, or run as root unless
they deliberately do so:

```yaml
spec:
  sidecar:
    container:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 32Mi
        limits:
          cpu: 200m
          memory: 64Mi
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1000
```

### Failure

A plugin may fail as follows:

* Connection/socket error - considered transient.
* Timeout - considered transient.
* 404 error - method is not supported by the plugin, as a result the method will not be called again (in the same workflow).
* 503 error - considered transient.
* Other 4xx/5xx errors - considered fatal.

Transient errors are retried, all other errors are considered fatal.

Fatal errors will result in failed steps.

### Requeue

It might be the case that the plugin can't finish straight away. E.g. it starts a long running task. When that happens,
you return "Pending" or "Running" a and a requeue time:

```json
{
  "node": {
    "phase": "Running",
    "message": "Long-running task started"
  },
  "requeue": "2m"
}
```

In this example, the task will be re-queued and `template.execute` will be called again in 2 minutes.

## Debugging

You can find the plugin's log in the agent pod's sidecar, e.g.:

```shell
kubectl -n argo logs ${agentPodName} -c hello-executor-plugin
```

## Listing Plugins

Because plugins are just config maps, you can list them using `kubectl`:

```shell
kubectl get cm -l workflows.argoproj.io/configmap-type=ExecutorPlugin
```

## Publishing Your Plugin

If you want to publish and share you plugin (we hope you do!), then submit a pull request to add it to the above
directory.
