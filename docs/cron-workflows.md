## Introduction

`CronWorkflow` are workflows that run on a preset schedule. They are designed to be converted from `Workflow` easily and to mimick the same options as Kubernetes `CronJob`. In essence, `CronWorkflow` = `Workflow` + some specific cron options.

## `CronWorkflow` Spec

An example `CronWorkflow` spec would look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: CronWorkflow
metadata:
  name: test-cron-wf
spec:
  schedule: "* * * * *"
  concurrencyPolicy: "Replace"
  startingDeadlineSeconds: 0
  workflowSpec:
    entrypoint: whalesay
    templates:
    - name: whalesay
      container:
        image: alpine:3.6
        command: [sh, -c]
        args: ["date; sleep 90"]
```

### `workflowSpec` and `workflowMetadata`

`CronWorkflow.spec.workflowSpec` is the same type as `Workflow.spec` and serves as a template for `Workflow` objects that are created from it. Everything under this spec will be converted to a `Workflow`.

The resuling `Workflow` name will be a generated name based on the `CronWorkflow` name. In this example it could be something like `test-cron-wf-tj6fe`.

`CronWorkflow.spec.workflowMetadata` can be used to add `labels` and `annotations`.

### `CronWorkflow` Options

|          Option Name         |      Default Value     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          `schedule`          | None, must be provided | Schedule at which the `Workflow` will be run. E.g. `5 4 * * * `                                                                                                                                                                         |
|          `timezone`          |    Machine timezone    | Timezone during which the Workflow will be run from the IANA timezone standard, e.g. `America/Los_Angeles`                                                                                                                              |
|           `suspend`          |         `false`        | If `true` Workflow scheduling will not occur. Can be set from the CLI, GitOps, or directly                                                                                                                                              |
|      `concurrencyPolicy`     |         `Allow`        | Policy that determines what to do if multiple `Workflows` are scheduled at the same time. Available options: `Allow`: allow all, `Replace`: remove all old before scheduling a new, `Forbid`: do not allow any new while there are old  |
| `startingDeadlineSeconds`    |           `0`          | Number of seconds after the last successful run during which a missed `Workflow` will be run                                                                                                                                            |
| `successfulJobsHistoryLimit` |           `3`          | Number of successful `Workflows` that will be persisted at a time                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `failedJobsHistoryLimit`     | `1`                    | Number of failed `Workflows` that will be persisted at a time                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Crash Recovery

If the `workflow-controller` crashes (and hence the `CronWorkflow` controller), there are some options you can set to ensure that `CronWorkflows` that would have been scheduled while the controller was down can still run. Mainly `startingDeadlineSeconds` can be set to specify the maximum number of seconds past the last successful run of a `CronWorkflow` during which a missed run will still be executed.

For example, if a `CronWorkflow` that runs every minute is last run at 12:05:00, and the controller crashes between 12:05:55 and 12:06:05, then the expected execution time of 12:06:00 would be missed. However, if `startingDeadlineSeconds` is set to a value greater than 65 (the amount of time passing between the last scheduled run time of 12:05:00 and the current controller restart time of 12:06:05), then a single instance of the `CronWorkflow` will be executed exactly at 12:06:05.

Currently only a single instance will be executed as a result of setting `startingDeadlineSeconds`.

This setting can also be configured in tandem with `concurrencyPolicy` to achieve more fine-tuned control.

### Daylight Saving

Daylight Saving (DST) is taken into account when using timezone. This means that, depending on the local time of the scheduled job, argo will schedule the workflow once, twice, or not at all when the clock moves forward or back.

For example, with timezone set at `America/Los_Angeles`, we have daylight saving 

- +1 hour (DST start) at 2020-03-08 02:00:00:

    **Note:** The schedules between 02:00 a.m. to 02:59 a.m. were skipped on Mar 8th due to the clock being moved forward:

    | cron       | sequence | workflow execution time       |
    |------------|----------|-------------------------------|
    | 59 1 * * * | 1        | 2020-03-08 01:59:00 -0800 PST |

- -1 hour (DST end) at 2020-11-01 02:00:00:

    **Note:** the schedules between 01:00 a.m. to 01:59 a.m. were triggered twice on Nov 1st due to the clock being set back:

    | cron       | sequence | workflow execution time       |

## Managing `CronWorkflow`

### CLI

`CronWorkflow` can be created from the CLI by using basic commands:

```sh
$ argo cron create cron.yaml
Name:                          test-cron-wf
Namespace:                     argo
Created:                       Mon Nov 18 10:17:06 -0800 (now)
Schedule:                      * * * * *
Suspended:                     false
StartingDeadlineSeconds:       0
ConcurrencyPolicy:             Forbid

$ argo cron list
NAME           AGE   LAST RUN   SCHEDULE    SUSPENDED
test-cron-wf   49s   N/A        * * * * *   false

# some time passes

$ argo cron list
NAME           AGE   LAST RUN   SCHEDULE    SUSPENDED
test-cron-wf   56s   2s         * * * * *   false

$ argo cron get test-cron-wf
Name:                          test-cron-wf
Namespace:                     argo
Created:                       Wed Oct 28 07:19:02 -0600 (23 hours ago)
Schedule:                      * * * * *
Suspended:                     false
StartingDeadlineSeconds:       0
ConcurrencyPolicy:             Replace
LastScheduledTime:             Thu Oct 29 06:51:00 -0600 (11 minutes ago)
NextScheduledTime:             Thu Oct 29 13:03:00 +0000 (32 seconds from now)
Active Workflows:              test-cron-wf-rt4nf
```

**Note**: `NextScheduledRun` assumes that the workflow-controller uses UTC as its timezone
