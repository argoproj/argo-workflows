# Cron Workflows

## Introduction

`CronWorkflow` are workflows that run on a preset schedule. They are designed to be converted from `Workflow` easily and to mimick the same options as Kubernetes `CronJob`. In essence, `CronWorkflow` = `Workflow` + some specific cron options.

## `CronWorkflow` Spec

An example `CronWorkflow` spec would look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: CronWorkflow
metadata:
  name: test-cron-wf
spec:
  schedule: "* * * * *"
  concurrencyPolicy: "Replace"
  startingDeadlineSeconds: 0
  workflowSpec:
    entrypoint: whalesay
    templates:
    - name: whalesay
      container:
        image: alpine:3.6
        command: [sh, -c]
        args: ["date; sleep 90"]
```

### `workflowSpec`

`CronWorkflow.spec.workflowSpec` is the same type as `Workflow.spec` and servers as a template for `Workflow` objects that are created from it. Everything under this spec will be converted to a `Workflow`.

The resuling `Workflow` name will be a generated name based on the `CronWorkflow` name. In this example it could be something like `test-cron-wf-tj6fe`.

### `CronWorkflow` Options

|          Option Name         |      Default Value     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          `schedule`          | None, must be provided | `Schedule at which the `Workflow` will be run. E.g. `5 4 * * *                                                                                                                                                                         |
|          `timezone`          |    Machine timezone    | Timezone during which the Workflow will be run. E.g. `America/Los_Angeles`                                                                                                                                                             |
|           `suspend`          |         `false`        | If `true` Workflow scheduling will not occur. Can be set from the CLI, GitOps, or directly                                                                                                                                             |
|      `concurrencyPolicy`     |         `Allow`        | Policy that determines what to do if multiple `Workflows` are scheduled at the same time. Available options: `Allow`: allow all, `Replace`: remove all old before scheduling a new, `Forbid`: do not allow any new while there are old |
| `startingDeadlineSeconds`    |           `0`          | Number of seconds after the last successful run during which a missed `Workflow` will be run                                                                                                                                           |
| `successfulJobsHistoryLimit` |           `3`          | Number of successful `Workflows` that will be persisted at a time                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `failedJobsHistoryLimit`     | `1`                    | Number of failed `Workflows` that will be persisted at a time                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Managing `CronWorkflow`

### CLI

`CronWorkflow` can be created from the CLI by using basic commands:

```sh
$ argo cron create cron.yaml
Name:                          test-cron-wf
Namespace:                     argo
Created:                       Mon Nov 18 10:17:06 -0800 (now)

Suspended:                     false
StartingDeadlineSeconds:       0
ConcurrencyPolicy:             Forbid

$ argo cron list
NAME           AGE   LAST RUN   SCHEDULE    SUSPENDED
test-cron-wf   49s   N/A        * * * * *   false

# some time passes

$ argo cron list
NAME           AGE   LAST RUN   SCHEDULE    SUSPENDED
test-cron-wf   56s   2s         * * * * *   false

$ argo cron get test-cron-wf
Name:                          test-cron-wf
Namespace:                     argo

```

### `kubectl`

Using `kubectl apply -f` and `kubectl get cwf`

### GitOps via Argo CD

`CronWorkflow` resources can be managed with GitOps by using [Argo CD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd)

### UI

`CronWorkflow` resources can also be managed by the UI
