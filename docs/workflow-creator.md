# Workflow Creator

![alpha](assets/alpha.svg)

> v2.9 and after

If you create your workflow via the CLI or UI, an attempt will be made to label it with the user who created it 

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: my-wf
  labels:
    workflows.argoproj.io/creator: admin
``` 

!!! NOTE
    Labels only contain `[-_.0-9a-zA-Z]`, so any other characters will be turned into `-`.
