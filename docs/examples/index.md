# Documentation by Example

## Welcome!

Argo is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition). As a result, Argo workflows can be managed using `kubectl` and natively integrates with other Kubernetes services such as volumes, secrets, and RBAC. The new Argo software is light-weight and installs in under a minute, and provides complete workflow features including parameter substitution, artifacts, fixtures, loops and recursive workflows.

Many of the Argo examples used in this walk-through are available in the [`examples` directory](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/tree/master/examples) on GitHub. If you like this project, please give us a star!

For a complete description of the Argo workflow spec, please refer to [the spec documentation](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/fields/#workflowspec).
