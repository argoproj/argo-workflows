# Synchronization

> v2.10 and after

You can limit the parallel execution of workflows or templates:

- You can use mutexes to restrict workflows or templates to only having a single concurrent execution.
- You can use semaphores to restrict workflows or templates to a configured number of parallel executions.
- You can use parallelism to restrict concurrent tasks or steps within a single workflow.

The term "locks" on this page means mutexes and semaphores.

You can create multiple semaphore configurations in a `ConfigMap` that can be referred to from a workflow or template.

For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
 name: my-config
data:
  workflow: "1"  # Only one workflow can run at given time in particular namespace
  template: "2"  # Two instances of template can run at a given time in particular namespace
```

!!! Warning
    Each synchronization block may only refer to either a semaphore or a mutex.
    If you specify both only the semaphore will be locked.

## Workflow-level Synchronization

You can limit parallel execution of workflows by using the same synchronization reference.

In this example the synchronization key `workflow` is configured as limit `"1"`, so only one workflow instance will execute at a time even if multiple workflows are created.

Using a semaphore configured by a `ConfigMap`:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: synchronization-wf-level-
spec:
  entrypoint: hello-world
  synchronization:
    semaphore:
      configMapKeyRef:
        name: my-config
        key: workflow
  templates:
  - name: hello-world
    container:
      image: busybox
      command: [echo]
      args: ["hello world"]
```

Using a mutex is equivalent to a limit `"1"` semaphore:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: synchronization-wf-level-
spec:
  entrypoint: hello-world
  synchronization:
    mutex:
      name: workflow
  templates:
  - name: hello-world
    container:
      image: busybox
      command: [echo]
      args: ["hello world"]
```

## Template-level Synchronization

You can limit parallel execution of templates by using the same synchronization reference.

In this example the synchronization key `template` is configured as limit `"2"`, so a maximum of two instances of the `acquire-lock` template will execute at a time.
This applies even when multiple steps or tasks within a workflow or different workflows refer to the same template.

Using a semaphore configured by a `ConfigMap`:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: synchronization-tmpl-level-
spec:
  entrypoint: synchronization-tmpl-level-example
  templates:
  - name: synchronization-tmpl-level-example
    steps:
    - - name: synchronization-acquire-lock
        template: acquire-lock
        arguments:
          parameters:
          - name: seconds
            value: "{{item}}"
        withParam: '["1","2","3","4","5"]'

  - name: acquire-lock
    synchronization:
      semaphore:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: my-config
          key: template
    container:
      image: alpine:latest
      command: [sh, -c]
      args: ["sleep 10; echo acquired lock"]
```

Using a mutex will limit to a single concurrent execution of the template:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: synchronization-tmpl-level-
spec:
  entrypoint: synchronization-tmpl-level-example
  templates:
  - name: synchronization-tmpl-level-example
    steps:
    - - name: synchronization-acquire-lock
        template: acquire-lock
        arguments:
          parameters:
          - name: seconds
            value: "{{item}}"
        withParam: '["1","2","3","4","5"]'

  - name: acquire-lock
    synchronization:
      mutex:
        name: template
    container:
      image: alpine:latest
      command: [sh, -c]
      args: ["sleep 10; echo acquired lock"]
```

Examples:

1. [Workflow level semaphore](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/examples/synchronization-wf-level.yaml)
1. [Workflow level mutex](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/examples/synchronization-mutex-wf-level.yaml)
1. [Step level semaphore](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/examples/synchronization-tmpl-level.yaml)
1. [Step level mutex](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/examples/synchronization-mutex-tmpl-level.yaml)

## Queuing

When a workflow cannot acquire a lock it will be placed into a ordered queue.

You can set a [`priority`](parallelism.md#priority) on workflows.
The queue is first ordered by priority: a higher priority number is placed before a lower priority number.
The queue is then ordered by `creationTimestamp`: older workflows are placed before newer workflows.

Workflows can only acquire a lock if they are at the front of the queue for that lock.

## Workflow-level parallelism

You can use `parallelism` within a workflow or template to restrict the total concurrent executions of steps or tasks.
(Note that this only restricts concurrent executions within the same workflow.)

Examples:

1. [`parallelism-limit.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/examples/parallelism-limit.yaml) restricts the parallelism of a [loop](walk-through/loops.md)
1. [`parallelism-nested.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/examples/parallelism-nested.yaml) restricts the parallelism of a nested loop
1. [`parallelism-nested-dag.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/examples/parallelism-nested-dag.yaml) restricts the number of dag tasks that can be run at any one time
1. [`parallelism-nested-workflow.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/examples/parallelism-nested-workflow.yaml) shows how parallelism is inherited by children
1. [`parallelism-template-limit.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/main/examples/parallelism-template-limit.yaml) shows how parallelism of looped templates is also restricted

## Other Parallelism support

You can also [restrict parallelism at the Controller-level](parallelism.md).
