# Mentoring

To help you get up to speed, or further develop you Argo Workflows contribution skills, you can now get a mentor.

Mentors will help you with things like:

* Resources to learn Golang, Typescript and React.
* Get Argo Workflows running in development mode on your laptop.
* Understand key concepts and learn your way around the source code
* Getting your first pull request with a code contribution created, reviewed and merged.

Mentors and mentees must abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
