Plugins allow you to extend Argo Workflows to add new capabilities.

* You don't need to learn Golang, you can write in any language, including Python.
* Simple: a plugin just responds to RPC HTTP requests.
* You can iterate quickly by changing the plugin at runtime.
* You can get your plugin running today, no need to wait 3-5 months for review, approval, merge and an Argo software
  release.

[Executor plugins](executor_plugins.md) can be written and installed by both users and admins.
