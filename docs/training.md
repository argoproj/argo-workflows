## Hands-On

We are working on a new web-based course featuring beginner and intermediate lessons. These allow to you try out Argo Workflows in your web browser without needing to install anything on your computer. Each lesson starts up a Kubernetes cluster that you can access via a web browser.

The course takes around 2 hours to complete and is the fastest way to learn Argo Workflows.
