## General

* [#13358](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/13358): You can use multiple mutexes and semaphores in the same workflow or template, and use both type of lock at the same time
* [#13419](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/13419): The controller uses a queue when archiving workflows to improve memory management when archiving a large number of workflows at once
* [#12441](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/12441): Plugins can now be stopped, so that a stopped workflow will shutdown its plugin nodes
* The OSS artifact driver:
    * [#12188](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/12188): Can now work with directories,
    * [#12907](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/12907): Supports deletion,
    * [#12908](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/12908): Supports streaming.
* [#12419](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/12419): Pod deletion will now happen in parallel to speed it up.
* [#13360](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/13360): You can use Shared Access Signatures to access artifacts stored in Azure.
* [#12413](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/12413): Workflow pods now have a kubernetes finalizer to try to prevent them being deleted prematurely

* [#12328](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/12328): Large and flat workflows where there are many steps that need resolving at the same time could time out during template referencing. This is now much faster.
* [#12568](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/12568): Kubernetes scheduling constraints such as node selectors and tolerations will now be honored where they are specified in a WorkflowTemplate. These will be applied to the task and step pods.

* [#12842](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/12842): You can now template the `name` and `template` in a `templateRef`. This allows for fully data driven workflow DAGs.

* [#13746](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/13746): Configuration option to avoid sending kubernetes Events for workflows.
* [#13745](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/13745): Added an option to skip workflow duration estimation because it can be expensive.

* [#12305](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/12305): You can also use a stop strategy on CronWorkflows to stop them running any more workflows after a set of conditions occur such as too many errors.
* [#13474](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/13474): CronWorkflows also now have a when expression to further tune which occurrences of the workflow will run and which may be skipped

## CLI
