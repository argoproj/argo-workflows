# Hardwired Artifacts

You can use any container image to generate any kind of artifact. In practice, however, certain types of artifacts are very common, so there is built-in support for git, HTTP, GCS, and S3 artifacts.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: hardwired-artifact-
spec:
  entrypoint: hardwired-artifact
  templates:
  - name: hardwired-artifact
    inputs:
      artifacts:
      # Check out the master branch of the argo repo and place it at /src
      # revision can be anything that git checkout accepts: branch, commit, tag, etc.
      - name: argo-source
        path: /src
        git:
          repo: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows.git
          revision: "master"
      # Download kubectl 1.8.0 and place it at /bin/kubectl
      - name: kubectl
        path: /bin/kubectl
        mode: 0755
        http:
          url: https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.8.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
      # Copy an s3 compatible artifact repository bucket (such as AWS, GCS and MinIO) and place it at /s3
      - name: objects
        path: /s3
        s3:
          endpoint: storage.googleapis.com
          bucket: my-bucket-name
          key: path/in/bucket
          accessKeySecret:
            name: my-s3-credentials
            key: accessKey
          secretKeySecret:
            name: my-s3-credentials
            key: secretKey
    container:
      image: debian
      command: [sh, -c]
      args: ["ls -l /src /bin/kubectl /s3"]
```
