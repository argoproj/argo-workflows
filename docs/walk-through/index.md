# About

Argo is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition). As a result, Argo workflows can be managed
using `kubectl` and natively integrates with other Kubernetes services such as volumes, secrets, and RBAC. The new Argo
software is light-weight and installs in under a minute, and provides complete workflow features including parameter
substitution, artifacts, fixtures, loops and recursive workflows.

Dozens of examples are available in
the [examples directory](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/tree/master/examples) on GitHub.

For a complete description of the Argo workflow spec, please refer
to [the spec documentation](../fields.md#workflowspec).

Progress through these examples in sequence to learn all the basics.

Start with [Argo CLI](argo-cli.md).
