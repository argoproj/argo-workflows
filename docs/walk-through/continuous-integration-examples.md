Continuous integration is a popular application for workflows.

Some quick examples of CI workflows:

- <https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/tree/master/examples/influxdb-ci.yaml>

And a CI `WorkflowTemplate` example:

- <https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/examples/ci-workflowtemplate.yaml>

A more detailed example is <https://github.com/sendible-labs/argo-workflows-ci-example>, which allows you to
create a local CI workflow for the purposes of learning.
