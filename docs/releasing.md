# Release Instructions

## Cherry-Picking Fixes

✋ Before you start, make sure you have created a release branch (e.g. `release-3.3`) and it's passing CI.
Please make sure that all patch releases (e.g. `v3.3.5`) should be released from their associated minor release branches (e.g. `release-3.3`)
to work well with our versioned website.

Then get a list of commits you may want to cherry-pick:

```bash
./hack/cherry-pick.sh release-3.3 "fix"
./hack/cherry-pick.sh release-3.3 "docs"
```

To automatically cherry-pick, run the following:

```bash
./hack/cherry-pick.sh release-3.3 "fix" false
```

Ignore:

* Fixes for features only on `main`.
* Dependency upgrades, unless they fix known security issues.
* Build or CI improvements, unless the release pipeline is blocked without them.

### Merge Conflicts

Then look for `failed to cherry-pick` in the log to find commits with merge conflicts and decide if a manual patch is necessary.

If you're not sure how to fix a merge conflict, the safest and least risky option is to _not_ cherry-pick the commit.
The commit can be revisited in the future if there is user demand or if necessary to prevent further conflicts.

Sometimes merge conflicts occur because a `build`, `chore`, `refactor` or other older commit was not previously cherry-picked.
You can cherry-pick the older commit in order to easily resolve the merge conflict.

If you do make a manual patch, add a note in the commit message of what you changed.
As prior examples, see: [`f19d6d6046`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/f19d6d60462fb23c95324ba924c0972d92465a67), [`fbc56d423d`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/fbc56d423d106610f899cd487c3bb4ae10a5e3d8), [`37c87dafee`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/37c87dafeed5f50ce96664d80009e7d9b4d23e0a)

### Testing

Cherry-pick the first commit. Run `make test` locally before pushing. If the build timeouts the build caches may have
gone, try re-running.

Don't cherry-pick another commit until the CI passes. It is harder to find the cause of a new failed build if the last
build failed too.

Cherry-picking commits one-by-one and then waiting for the CI will take a long time. Instead, cherry-pick each commit then
run `make test` locally before pushing.

## Publish Release

✋ Before you start, make sure the branch is passing CI.

Push a new tag to the release branch. E.g.:

```bash
git tag v3.3.4
git push upstream v3.3.4 # or origin if you do not use upstream
```

GitHub Actions will automatically build and publish your release. This takes about 1h. Set your self a reminder to check
this was successful.

## Update Changelog

Once the tag is published, GitHub Actions will automatically open a PR to update the changelog. Once the PR is ready,
you can approve it, enable auto-merge, and then run the following to force trigger the CI build:

```bash
git branch -D create-pull-request/changelog
git fetch upstream
git checkout --track upstream/create-pull-request/changelog
git commit -s --allow-empty -m "chore: Force trigger CI"
git push upstream create-pull-request/changelog
```

## Announce on Slack

Once the changelog updates have been merged, you should announce on our Slack channels, [`#argo-workflows`](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01QW9QSSSK) and [`#argo-announcements`](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C02165G1L48).
See [previous](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C02165G1L48/p1701112932434469) [announcements](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01QW9QSSSK/p1701112957127489) as examples of what to write in the patch announcement.

In `#argo-workflows`, also "Pin" the release announcement and "Un-pin" the previous announcement for that release branch.
