# Release Instructions

Allow 1h to do a release.

## Preparation

* [ ] Cherry-pick your changes from master onto the release branch.
* [ ] The release branch should be green in CI before you start.

## Release

Releasing requires a clean tree state, so back-up any untracked files in your Git directory.

**Only once your files are backed up**, run:

    git clean -fdx  # WARNING: Will delete untracked files!

To generate new manifests and perform basic checks:

    make prepare-release -B VERSION=v2.11.5

Publish the images and local Git changes (disabling K3D as this is faster and more reliable for releases):

    make publish-release K3D=false VERSION=v2.11.5
    
Wait 1h to 2h.    
 
* [ ] Check the images were pushed successfully.
* [ ] Check the correct versions are printed.
* [ ] Check the executor was correctly built.

```
docker run argoproj/argoexec:v2.11.5 version
docker run argoproj/workflow-controller:v2.11.5 version
docker run argoproj/argocli:v2.11.5 version
```

* [ ] Check the manifests contain the correct tags: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/v2.11.5/manifests/install.yaml

* [ ] Check the manifests apply: `kubectl -n argo apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/v2.11.5/manifests/install.yaml`
