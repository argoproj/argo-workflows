# Release Instructions

Allow 1h to do a release.

## Preparation

Cherry-pick your changes from master onto the release branch.

The release branch should be green [in CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/github/argoproj/argo/pipelines) before you start.

## Release

To generate new manifests and perform basic checks:

    make prepare-release VERSION=v2.7.2

Publish the images and local Git changes (disabling K3D as this is faster and more reliable for releases):

    make publish-release K3D=false VERSION=v2.7.2

* [ ] Check the images were pushed successfully.

```
docker pull argoproj/workflow-controller:v2.7.2
docker pull argoproj/argoexec:v2.7.2
docker pull argoproj/argocli:v2.7.2
```

* [ ] Check the correct versions are printed:

```
docker run argoproj/workflow-controller:v2.7.2 version
docker run argoproj/argoexec:v2.7.2 version
docker run argoproj/argocli:v2.7.2 version
```

* [ ] Check the manifests contain the correct tags: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo/v2.7.2/manifests/install.yaml
