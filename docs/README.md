## What is Argo Workflows?

Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes.
Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition).

* Define workflows where each step is a container.
* Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
* Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo Workflows on Kubernetes.

Argo is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://cncf.io/) graduated project.

## Use Cases

* [Machine Learning pipelines](use-cases/machine-learning.md)
* [Data and batch processing](use-cases/data-processing.md)
* [Infrastructure automation](use-cases/infrastructure-automation.md)
* [CI/CD](use-cases/ci-cd.md)
* [Other use cases](use-cases/other.md)

## Why Argo Workflows?

* Argo Workflows is the most popular workflow execution engine for Kubernetes.
* Light-weight, scalable, and easier to use.
* Designed from the ground up for containers without the overhead and limitations of legacy VM and server-based environments.
* Cloud agnostic and can run on any Kubernetes cluster.
