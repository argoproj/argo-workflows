# Argo Workflows

Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo
Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition).

* Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container.
* Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a directed acyclic
  graph (DAG).
* Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo
  Workflows on Kubernetes.
* Run CI/CD pipelines natively on Kubernetes without configuring complex software development products.
