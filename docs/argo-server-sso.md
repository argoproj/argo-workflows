# Argo Server SSO

![GA](assets/ga.svg)

> v2.9 and after

It is possible to use [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex) for authentication. [This document](argo-server-sso-argocd.md) describes how to set up ArgoWorkflows and ArgoCD so that ArgoWorkflows uses ArgoCD's Dex server for authentication.

## To start Argo Server with SSO.

Firstly, configure the settings [workflow-controller-configmap.yaml](workflow-controller-configmap.yaml) with the correct OAuth 2 values. If working towards an oidc configuration the ArgoCD project has [guides](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/user-management/#existing-oidc-provider) on its similar (though different) process for setting up oidc providers. It also includes examples for specific providers. The main difference is that the ArgoCD docs mention that their callback address endpoint is `/auth/callback`.  For ArgoWorkflows, the default format is `/oauth2/callback` as shown in [this comment](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/93c11a24ff06049c2197149acd787f702e5c1f9b/docs/workflow-controller-configmap.yaml#L329) in the default values.yaml file in the helm chart.

Next, create the k8s secrets for holding the OAuth2 `client-id` and `client-secret`. You may refer to the kubernetes documentation on [Managing secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configmap-secret/). For example by using kubectl with literals:
```
kubectl create secret -n argo generic client-id-secret \
  --from-literal=client-id-key=foo

kubectl create secret -n argo generic client-secret-secret \
  --from-literal=client-secret-key=bar
```

Then, start the Argo Server using the SSO [auth mode](argo-server-auth-mode.md):

```
argo server --auth-mode sso --auth-mode ...
```

## Token Revocation

> v2.12 and after

As of v2.12 we issue a JWE token for users rather than give them the ID token from your OAuth2 provider. This token is opaque and has a longer expiry time (10h by default).

The token encryption key is automatically generated by the Argo Server and stored in a Kubernetes secret name "sso".

You can revoke all tokens by deleting the encryption key and restarting the Argo Server (so it generates a new key).

```
kubectl delete secret sso
```

!!! Warning
    The old key will be in the memory the any running Argo Server, and they will therefore accept and user with token encrypted using the old key. Every Argo Server MUST be restarted.

All users will need to log in again. Sorry.


## SSO RBAC

> v2.12 and after

You can optionally add RBAC to SSO. This allows you to give different users different access levels. Except for `client` auth mode, all users of the Argo Server must ultimately use a service account. So we allow you to define rules that map a user (maybe using their OIDC groups) to a service account in the same namespace as argo server by annotating the service account.

To allow service accounts to manage resources in other namespaces create a role and role binding in the target namespace.

RBAC config is installation-level, so any changes will need to be made by the team that installed Argo. Many complex rules will be burdensome on that team.

Firstly, enable the `rbac:` setting in [workflow-controller-configmap.yaml](workflow-controller-configmap.yaml). You almost certainly want to be able configure RBAC using groups, so add `scopes:` to the SSO settings:

```yaml
sso:
  # ...
  scopes:
   - groups
  rbac:
    enabled: true
```

!!! Note
    Not all OIDC provider support the groups scope. Please speak to your provider about their options.

To configure a service account to be used, annotate it:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: admin-user
  annotations:
    # The rule is an expression used to determine if this service account
    # should be used.
    # * `groups` - an array of the OIDC groups
    # * `iss` - the issuer ("argo-server")
    # * `sub` - the subject (typically the username)
    # Must evaluate to a boolean.
    # If you want an account to be the default to use, this rule can be "true".
    # Details of the expression language are available in
    # https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/master/docs/Language-Definition.md.
    workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule: "'admin' in groups"
    # The precedence is used to determine which service account to use whe
    # Precedence is an integer. It may be negative. If omitted, it defaults to "0".
    # Numerically higher values have higher precedence (not lower, which maybe
    # counter-intuitive to you).
    # If two rules match and have the same precedence, then which one used will
    # be arbitrary.
    workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule-precedence: "1"
```


If no rule matches, we deny the user access.

!!! Tip
    You'll probably want to configure a default account to use if no other rule matches, e.g. a read-only account, you can do this as follows:

    ```yaml
    metadata:
      name: read-only
      annotations:
        workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule: "true"
        workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule-precedence: "0"
    ```

    The precedence must be the lowest of all your service accounts.

## SSO RBAC Namespace Delegation

> v3.3 and after

You can optionally configure RBAC SSO per namespace.
Typically, on organization has a K8s cluster and a central team manages the cluster who is the owner of the cluster. Along with this, there are multiple namespaces which are owned by individual team. This feature would help namespace owners to define RBAC for their own namespace.

The feature is currently in beta.
To enable the feature, set env variable `SSO_DELEGATE_RBAC_TO_NAMESPACE=true` in your argo-server deployment.

#### Recommended usage

Configure a default account in the installation namespace which would allow all users of your organization. We will use this service account to allow a user to login to the cluster. You could optionally add workflow read-only role and rolebinding if you wish to.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: user-default-login
  annotations:
    workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule: "true"
    workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule-precedence: "0"
```

Now, for the the namespace that you own, configure a service account which would allow members of your team to perform operations in your namespace.
Make sure that the precedence of the namespace service account is higher than the precedence of the login service account. Create approprite role that you want to grant to this serviceaccount and bind it with a role-binding.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: my-namespace-read-write-user
  namespace: my-namespace
  annotations:
    workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule: "'my-team' in groups"
    workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule-precedence: "1"
```

Using this, whenever a user is logged in via SSO and makes a request in 'my-namespace', and the `rbac-rule`matches, we will use this service account to allow the user to perform that operation in the namespace. If no serviceaccount matches in the namespace, the first serviceaccount(`user-default-login`) and its associated role will be used to perform the operation in the namespace.

## SSO Login Time

> v2.12 and after

By default, your SSO session will expire after 10 hours. You can change this by adding a sessionExpiry value to your [workflow-controller-configmap.yaml](workflow-controller-configmap.yaml) under the SSO heading.

```yaml
sso:
  # Expiry defines how long your login is valid for in hours. (optional)
  sessionExpiry: 240h
```
## Custom claims

> v3.1.4 and after

If your OIDC provider provides groups information with a claim name other than `groups`, you could configure config-map to specify custom claim name for groups. Argo now arbitrary custom claims and any claim can be used for `expr eval`. However, since group information is displayed in UI, it still needs to be an array of strings with group names as elements.

customClaim in this case will be mapped to `groups` key and we can use the same key `groups` for evaluating our expressions

```yaml
sso:
  # Specify custom claim name for OIDC groups.
  customGroupClaimName: argo_groups
```

If your OIDC provider provides groups information only using the userInfo endpoint (e.g. OKta), you could configure `userInfoPath` to specify the user info endpoint that contains the groups claim.
```yaml
sso:
  userInfoPath: /oauth2/v1/userinfo
```

#### Example expr

```shell
# assuming customClaimGroupName: argo_groups
workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule: "'argo_admins' in groups"
```
