# This example demonstrates the loading of a hard-wired input artifact from an OSS compliant
# store. OSS guards access to buckets using an access key and
# secret key, which will be stored as regular Kubernetes secrets, and referenced in the
# workflow using secret selectors. To create the secret required for this example, first
# run the following command:
# $ kubectl create secret generic my-oss-credentials --from-literal=accessKey=<YOUR-OSS-ACCESS-ID> --from-literal=secretKey=<YOUR-OSS-SECRET-KEY>
