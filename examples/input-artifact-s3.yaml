# This example demonstrates the loading of a hard-wired input artifact from an S3 compliant
# store. This can be AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) with interoperability enabled,
# or a self-hosted minio service. S3 guards access to buckets using an access key and
# secret key, which will be stored as regular Kubernetes secrets, and referenced in the
# workflow using secret selectors. To create the secret required for this example, first
# run the following command:
# $ kubectl create secret generic my-s3-credentials --from-literal=accessKey=<YOUR-ACCESS-KEY> --from-literal=secretKey=<YOUR-SECRET-KEY>
