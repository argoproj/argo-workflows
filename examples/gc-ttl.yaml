# This example shows the ability to automatically delete workflows after a specified time period
# after the workflow completes. The TTLStrategy sets the strategy for how long workflows that are
# successful, not successful, or completed should live. The former ttlSecondsAfterFinished will be
# deprecated  and will be replaced with TTLStrategy.SecondsAfterCompleted.
