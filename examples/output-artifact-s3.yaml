# This is an example of a workflow producing an S3 output artifact which is saved to a hard-wired
# location. This is useful for workflows which want to publish results to a well known or

        # It is possible to disable tar.gz archiving by setting the archive strategy to 'none'
        # Disabling archiving has the following limitations on S3: symbolic links will not be
        # uploaded, as S3 does not support the concept/file mode of symlinks.
        # archive:
        #   none: {}

          # Use the corresponding endpoint depending on your S3 provider:
          #   AWS: s3.amazonaws.com

          # you can set additional statement policy that allows `s3:GetBucketLocation` action.

          # NOTE: by default, output artifacts are automatically tarred and gzipped before saving.
          # As a best practice, .tgz or .tar.gz should be suffixed into the key name so the
          # resulting object has an accurate file extension and mime-type. If archive is set to
          # 'none', then preserve the appropriate file extension for the key name
          key: path/in/bucket/hello_world.txt.tgz

          # accessKeySecret and secretKeySecret are secret selectors. It references the k8s secret
          # named 'my-s3-credentials'. This secret is expected to have have the keys 'accessKey'
          # and 'secretKey', containing the base64 encoded credentials to the bucket.
