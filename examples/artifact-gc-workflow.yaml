# This example shows how you can configure Artifact Garbage Collection for your Workflow.
# Here there are two artifacts - one is automatically deleted when the Workflow completes, and the other
# is deleted when the Workflow gets deleted.
# In this case, "OnWorkflowDeletion" is defined for all artifacts by default, but the "on-completion" artifact
# overrides that default strategy.
