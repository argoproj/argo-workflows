# This example demonstrates the loading of a hard-wired input artifact from an Azure
# Storage store. Azure guards access to the storage account with an access key which
# can be stored as a regular Kubernetes secret, and referenced in the workflow using
# secret selectors. If managed identities have been applied to the pods, then the
# parameter UseSDKCreds can be set to true, and managed identity authentication will
# be used instead of the secret. If a secret is used, the required secret can be created
# with the following command:
# $ kubectl create secret generic my-azure-credentials --from-literal=accountKey=<YOUR-ACCESS-KEY>
