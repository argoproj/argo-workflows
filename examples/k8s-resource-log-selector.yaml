# This example demonstrates how to include and obtain logs from pods created by a
# custom resource submitted via resource template. Note that this feature is only
# available in v3.3 and above.
#
# This is particularly useful since Argo Workflows does not know how
# other CRDs (Kubeflow training CRDs, Spark application CRD, etc.) work
# and thus could not pull the logs from the pods created by those CRDs.
