# An exit handler is a template reference that executes at the end of the workflow
# irrespective of the success, failure, or error of the primary workflow. To specify
# an exit handler, reference the name of a template in 'spec.onExit'.
# Some common use cases of exit handlers are:
# - sending notifications of workflow status (e.g. e-mail/slack)
# - posting the pass/fail status to a webhook result (e.g. github build result)
# - cleaning up workflow artifacts
# - resubmitting or submitting another workflow

      # Tip: {{workflow.failures}} is a JSON list. If you're using bash to read it, we recommend using jq to manipulate

      #
      # echo "{{workflow.failures}}" | jq -r '.[] | "Failed Step: \(.displayName)\tMessage: \(.message)"'
      #
      # Will print a list of all the failed steps and their messages. For more info look up the jq docs.
      # Note: jq is not installed by default on the "alpine:latest" image, however it can be installed with "apk add jq"
