# An exit handler is a template reference that executes at the end of the workflow
# irrespective of the success, failure, or error of the primary workflow. To specify
# an exit handler, reference the name of a template in 'spec.onExit'.
# Some common use cases of exit handlers are:
# - sending notifications of workflow status (e.g. e-mail/slack)
# - posting the pass/fail status to a webhook result (e.g. github build result)
# - cleaning up workflow artifacts
# - resubmitting or submitting another workflow
