      This workflow demonstrates using an annotation to run a the pod using a different executor to the default
      configured executor.

      In this example, it uses a label that state the executor to use explictly, but you can also do this indirectly,
      e.g. have a certain labels use certain executors.

    # this workflow will success because contrary to the default emissary executor,
    # the pns executor doesn't require an explicit command defined
