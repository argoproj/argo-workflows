# This example shows how to create a stateful set with an attached service to use as a daemoned server.
# It is complete with a tear-down handler, and a wait step that ensures the stateful set is ready before continuing.
# Note that the service account that Argo uses to run this must have sufficient permissions to create, delete, and get
# the resources.
