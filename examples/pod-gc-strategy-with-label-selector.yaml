# Pod GC provides the ability to delete pods automatically without deleting the workflow.
# This example also demonstrates the use of `podGC.labelSelector` (available since v3.0.0-rc3)
# to only delete the pods whose labels match with the specified label selector.

  podGC:
    # Pod GC strategy must be one of the following:
    # * OnPodCompletion - delete pods immediately when pod is completed (including errors/failures)
    # * OnPodSuccess - delete pods immediately when pod is successful
    # * OnWorkflowCompletion - delete pods when workflow is completed
    # * OnWorkflowSuccess - delete pods when workflow is successful
