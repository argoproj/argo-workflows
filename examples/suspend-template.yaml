# This example demonstrates the use of a suspend template. Suspend templates allow a workflow to
# enter a suspended state at a predetermined point in time in the workflow. Some use cases for this
# might include: human approval during release process, performing asynchronous/long soak tests,
# manual judgment of a staging environment before deploying to production. To run this example,
# submit the workflow and wait until the workflow reaches the second, "approve" step, at which point
# the workflow will be suspended. To resume the workflow, run:
# argo resume <workflowname>
# A suspended template can also be specified with `duration` which will automatically resume the
# suspended template after the specified amount of time in seconds. In this example it is used to delay
# a release after an approval.
