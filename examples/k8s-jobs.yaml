# This example demonstrates the 'resource' template type, which provides a
# convenient way to create/update/delete any type of kubernetes resources
# in a workflow. The resource template type accepts any k8s manifest
# (including CRDs) and can perform any kubectl action against it (e.g. create,
# apply, delete, patch).

      # successCondition and failureCondition are optional expressions which are
      # evaluated upon every update of the resource. If failureCondition is ever
      # evaluated to true, the step is considered failed. Likewise, if successCondition
      # is ever evaluated to true the step is considered successful. It uses kubernetes
      # label selection syntax and can be applied against any field of the resource
      # (not just labels). Multiple AND conditions can be represented by comma
      # delimited expressions. For more details, see:
