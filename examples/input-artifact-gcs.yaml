# This example demonstrates the loading of a hard-wired input artifact from a GCP storage.
#
# It uses a GCP Service Account Key stored as a regular Kubernetes secret, to access GCP storage.
# To create the secret required for this example, first run the following command:
#
# $ kubectl create secret generic my-gcs-credentials --from-file=serviceAccountKey=<YOUR-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-KEY-file>
