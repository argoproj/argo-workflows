                          UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy defines the criteria for when unhealthy pods
                          should be considered for eviction. Current implementation considers healthy pods,
                          as pods that have status.conditions item with type="Ready",status="True".

                          Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow.
                          If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used,
                          which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.

                          IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                          but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not
                          disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy).
                          Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                          AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                          but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless
                          of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running
                          pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy.
                          Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                          Additional policies may be added in the future.
                          Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods
                          if they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.

                          seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                          It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                          Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                          "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                          This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                          "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                          This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                          It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                          Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                          whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                          CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                          "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                          If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                          If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                          and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                          This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                          All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                  preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                  container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                  PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                  container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                  period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                  or until the termination grace period is reached.

                              RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                              This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                              For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                              the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                              Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                              this init container will be continually restarted on
                              exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                              containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                              will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                              is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                              container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                              for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                              container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                              init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                              completed.

                                    RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                    recursively.

                                    If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                    If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                    recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                    recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                    field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                    supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                    an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                    If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                    None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                    If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                        preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                        container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                        PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                        container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                        period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                        or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                        The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                        a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.

                                        If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this

                                    For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                    the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                    Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                    this init container will be continually restarted on
                                    exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                    containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                    will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                    is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                    container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                    for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                    container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                    init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                    completed.

                              This flag is for DAG logic. The DAG logic has a built-in "fail fast" feature to stop scheduling new steps,
                              as soon as it detects that one of the DAG nodes is failed. Then it waits until all DAG nodes are completed
                              before failing the DAG itself.
                              The FailFast flag default is true,  if set to false, it will allow a DAG to run all branches of the DAG to
                              completion (either success or failure), regardless of the failed outcomes of branches in the DAG.

                                Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable

                                to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
                                produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless
                                of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                  MaxDuration is the maximum amount of time allowed for a workflow in the backoff strategy.
                                  It is important to note that if the workflow template includes activeDeadlineSeconds, the pod's deadline is initially set with activeDeadlineSeconds.
                                  However, when the workflow fails, the pod's deadline is then overridden by maxDuration.
                                  This ensures that the workflow does not exceed the specified maximum duration when retries are involved.

                                  preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                  container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                  PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                  container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                  period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                  or until the termination grace period is reached.

                              RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                              This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                              For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                              the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                              Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                              this init container will be continually restarted on
                              exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                              containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                              will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                              is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                              container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                              for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                              container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                              init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                              completed.

                              seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                              It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                              Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                              "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                              This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                              "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                              This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                              It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                              Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                              whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                              CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                              "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                              If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                              If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                              and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                              This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                              All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                    PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                    API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                    preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                    container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                    container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                Use this if:
                                a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                   tracking are needed,
                                c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                   information on the connection between this volume type
                                   and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                of an individual pod.

                                Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                more information.

                                A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                persistent volumes at the same time.
                              properties:

                                    Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                    The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                    owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                    pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                    `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                    entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                    is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                    An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                    will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                    volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                    the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                    meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                    owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                    this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                    manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                            volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non

                                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                            When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is

                                image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                    Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                    IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                    Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                    Pull secrets will be assembled in the same way as for the container image by looking up node credentials, SA image pull secrets, and pod spec image pull secrets.

                                Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable
                                cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
                                produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless
                                of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.

                                            not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions ('|', etc) won't work. To use

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                      Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable
                                      cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                      to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will

                                          preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                          container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                          container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                      RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                      This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                      For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                      the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                      Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                      this init container will be continually restarted on
                                      exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                      containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                      will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                      is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                      container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                      for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                      container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                      init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                      completed.

                                This flag is for DAG logic. The DAG logic has a built-in "fail fast" feature to stop scheduling new steps,
                                as soon as it detects that one of the DAG nodes is failed. Then it waits until all DAG nodes are completed
                                before failing the DAG itself.
                                The FailFast flag default is true,  if set to false, it will allow a DAG to run all branches of the DAG to
                                completion (either success or failure), regardless of the failed outcomes of branches in the DAG.

                                        the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                        to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.
                                        "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".
                                        Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable
                                        exists or not.

                                  RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                  This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                  For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                  the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                  Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                  this init container will be continually restarted on
                                  exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                  containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                  will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                  is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                  container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                  for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                  container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                  init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                  completed.

                                    It is important to note that if the workflow template includes activeDeadlineSeconds, the pod's deadline is initially set with activeDeadlineSeconds.
                                    However, when the workflow fails, the pod's deadline is then overridden by maxDuration.
                                    This ensures that the workflow does not exceed the specified maximum duration when retries are involved.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                      container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                      PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                      period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                      or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                  RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                  This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                  For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                  the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                  Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                  this init container will be continually restarted on
                                  exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                  containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                  will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                  is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                  container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                  for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                  container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                  init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                  completed.

                                        recursively.

                                        If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                        If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                        recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made

                                        If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                  ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                  The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                  and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                  Use this if:
                                  a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                  b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                     tracking are needed,
                                  c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                  d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                     a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                     information on the connection between this volume type
                                     and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                  Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                  APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                  of an individual pod.

                                  Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                  be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                  more information.

                                  A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                  persistent volumes at the same time.

                                      Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                      The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                      owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                      pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                      `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                      entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                      is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                      An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                      will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                      volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                      the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                      meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                      owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                      this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                      manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                              provisioner.
                                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                specified.
                                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                in any namespaces.
                                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                  image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                  The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                  - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                  - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                  - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                  The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                  A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                  The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                  The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                  The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                  Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                  The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                provisioner.
                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                  in any namespaces.

                          description: |-
                            ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                            The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                            and deleted when the pod is removed.

                            Use this if:
                            a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                            b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                               tracking are needed,
                            c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                            d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                               a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                               information on the connection between this volume type
                               and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                            Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                            APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                            of an individual pod.

                            Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                            be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                            more information.

                            A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                            persistent volumes at the same time.

                                Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,

                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                            The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                            - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                            - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                            - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                            The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                            A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                            The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                            The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                            The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                            Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                            The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
