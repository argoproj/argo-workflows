# This script will return an error if the current branch introduces unstructured logging statements, such as:
#
# Errorf/Warningf/Warnf/Infof/Debugf
#
# Unstructured logging is not machine readable, so it is not possible to build reports from it, or efficiently query on it.
#
# Most production system will not be logging at debug level, so why ban Debugf?
#
# * You may change debug logging to info.
# * To encourage best practice.
#
# What to do if really must format your log messages.
#
# I've tried hard to think of any occasion when I'd prefer unstructured logging. I can't think of any times, but here
# might be some edge cases.
#
# As a last resort, use `log.Info(fmt.Sprintf(""))`.
