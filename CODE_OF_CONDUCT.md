# Code of Conduct

We welcome participation from individuals and groups of all backgrounds who want to benefit the broader open source community
through participation in this project. We are dedicated to ensuring a productive, safe and educational experience for all.

# Guidelines

Be welcoming
* Make it easy for new members to learn and contribute. Help them along the path. Don't make them jump through hoops.

Be considerate
* There is a live person at the other end of the Internet. Consider how your comments will affect them. It is often better to give a quick but useful reply than to delay to compose a more thorough reply.

Be respectful
* Not everyone is Linus Torvalds, and this is probably a good thing :) but everyone is deserving of respect and consideration for wanting to benefit the broader community. Criticize ideas but respect the person. Saying something positive before you criticize lets the other person know that your criticism is not personal.

Be patient
* We have diverse backgrounds. It will take time and effort to understand each others' points of view. Some of us have day jobs and other responsibilities and may take time to respond to requests.
