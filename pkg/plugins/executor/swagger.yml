            An AWS EBS disk must exist before mounting to a container. The disk
            must also be in the same AWS zone as the kubelet. An AWS EBS disk
            can only be mounted as read/write once. AWS EBS volumes support
            ownership management and SELinux relabeling.

                    fsType is the filesystem type of the volume that you want to mount.
                    Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system.
                    Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

                    before failing the DAG itself.
                    The FailFast flag default is true,  if set to false, it will allow a DAG to run all branches of the DAG to
                    completion (either success or failure), regardless of the failed outcomes of branches in the DAG.

                    DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
                    field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
                    directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
                    from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
                    finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
                    Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
                    future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
                    For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
                    by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
                    the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
                    remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
                    exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
                    resource is fully terminated.
                    If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

                    in this list can only be removed.
                    Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
                    because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
                    finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
                    If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
                    in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
                    waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
                    component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
                    Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
                    are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

    Quantity:
        description: |-
            The serialization format is:

            ```
            <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>

            (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)

            <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9
            <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits>
            <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits>
            <sign>            ::= "+" | "-"
            <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number>
            <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI>
            <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei

            (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)

            <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E

            (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)

            <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
            ```

            No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent
            a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal
            places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up.
            (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.)
            This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

            When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix
            it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

            Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form".
            This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a
            corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:

            No precision is lost
            No fractional digits will be emitted
            The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.

            The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

            Examples:

            1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
            1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"

            Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a
            floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

            Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed,
            but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical
            form, or don't diff.)

            This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without
            writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will
            cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.
