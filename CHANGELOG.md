## 2.3.0-rc1 (2019-04-10)

### Notes about upgrading from v2.2

* Secrets are passed to the wait sidecar using volumeMounts instead of performing K8s API calls
  performed by the. This is much more secure since it limits the privileges of the workflow pod
  to no longer require namespace level secret access. However, as a consequence, workflow pods which
  reference a secret that does not exist, will now indefinitely stay in a Pending state, as opposed
  to the previous behavior of failing during runtime.


### Deprecation Notice
The workflow-controller-configmap introduces a new config field, `executor`, which is a container 
spec and provides controls over the executor sidecar container (i.e. `init`/`wait`). The fields
`executorImage`, `executorResources`, and `executorImagePullPolicy` are deprecated and will be
removed in a future release.

## 2.2.0 (2018-08-30)

### Notes about upgrading from v2.1

* The `argo install` and `argo uninstall` commands have been removed from the CLI. Instead, plain
kubernetes manifests are provided to be installed using `kubectl apply`, or downstreamed into other
tools (e.g. helm chart, ksonnet prototype, kustomize, etc...).
* In 2.1, argo would install into the kube-system namespace by default. The new install instructions
have been updated to install into a different namespace, `argo`. In order to move to the recommended
installation location, you should delete the v2.1 resources from kube-system before applying the
new manifests to the `argo` namespace.

    The following commands migrates the workflow-controller-configmap from the `kube-system` to the
`argo` namespace, and deletes all argo resources from the `kube-system` namespace. Note that this
will delete the argo-ui service, resulting in the LoadBalancer being deleted (if created).

    ```
    kubectl get cm workflow-controller-configmap -o yaml -n kube-system --export | kubectl apply -n argo -f -
    kubectl delete -n kube-system cm workflow-controller-configmap
    kubectl delete -n kube-system deploy workflow-controller argo-ui
    kubectl delete -n kube-system sa argo argo-ui
    kubectl delete -n kube-system svc argo-ui
    ```

* In 2.1, the argoexec sidecar image was configured in the workflow-controller-configmap. This is
now configured using a new `--executor-image` flag in the `workflow-controller` deployment. This is
the preferred way to configure the executor image, since upgrades can now be performed without
changing the workflow-controller configmap. The executorImage setting in the config is deprecated
and may be removed/ignored in a future release.
