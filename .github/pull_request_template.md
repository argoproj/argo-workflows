Do not open a pull request until you have:

* Run `make pre-commit -B` to fix codegen and lint problems (build will fail).
* [Sign-off your commits](https://github.com/apps/dco/) (otherwise the DCO check will fail).
* Use [a conventional commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).


When you open your PR

* "Fixes #" is in both the PR title (for release notes) and this description (to automatically link and close the issue).
* Create the PR as draft.
* Once build are green, mark your PR "Ready for review".

When changes are requested, please address them and then dismiss the review to get it reviewed again.
