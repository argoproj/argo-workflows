Before we start, around 2/3 of issues can be fixed by one of the following:

* Have you double-checked your configuration? Maybe 30% of issues are wrong configuration.
* Are you running the latest version? Maybe 20% of issues are fixed by this.
* Have you tried using the Emissary executor? Maybe 50% of artifact related issues are fixed by this.

If this is a regression, please open a regression report instead.
-->

## Summary

What happened/what you expected to happen?

What executor are you using? PNS/Emissary

## Diagnostics

Paste the smallest workflow that reproduces the bug. We must be able to run the workflow.

```yaml

```

What executor are you running? PNS/Emissary

```bash
# Logs from the workflow controller:
kubectl logs -n argo deploy/workflow-controller | grep ${workflow} 

# If the workflow's pods have not been created, you can skip the rest of the diagnostics.

# The workflow's pods that are problematic:
kubectl get pod -o yaml -l workflows.argoproj.io/workflow=${workflow},workflow.argoproj.io/phase!=Succeeded

# Logs from in your workflow's wait container, something like:
kubectl logs -c wait -l workflows.argoproj.io/workflow=${workflow},workflow.argoproj.io/phase!=Succeeded
```
