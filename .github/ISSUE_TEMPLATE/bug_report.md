## Summary 

What happened/what you expected to happen?

## Diagnostics

üëÄ Yes! We need all of your diagnostics, please make sure you add it all, otherwise we'll go around in circles asking you for it:

What Kubernetes provider are you using? 

What version of Argo Workflows are you running? 

What executor are you running? Docker/K8SAPI/Kubelet/PNS/Emissary

Did this work in a previous version? I.e. is it a regression?

Are you pasting thousands of log lines? That's too much information. 

```bash
# Either a workflow that reproduces the bug, or paste you whole workflow YAML, including status, something like:
kubectl get wf -o yaml ${workflow}

# Logs from the workflow controller:
kubectl logs -n argo deploy/workflow-controller | grep ${workflow}

# The workflow's pods that are problematic:
kubectl get pod -o yaml -l workflows.argoproj.io/workflow=${workflow},workflow.argoproj.io/phase!=Succeeded

# Logs from in your workflow's wait container, something like:
kubectl logs -c wait -l workflows.argoproj.io/workflow=${workflow},workflow.argoproj.io/phase!=Succeeded
```
