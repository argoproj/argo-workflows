Are you a contributor? If not, have you thought about it? 

Argo Workflows is seeking more community involvement and ultimately more [Reviewers and Approvers](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/blob/main/community/membership.md) to help keep it viable. 

We are gauging interest in a potential system in which many companies pledge a little bit of time each to help get more people into these roles. 
See [#12229](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/12229) for more information. 
If you think you or your company may be interested in getting involved, please add a comment to the issue.
