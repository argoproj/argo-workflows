# Workflow level timeouts can be specified with the field, spec.activeDeadlineSeconds.
# This value represents the duration in seconds relative to the workflow start time which a workflow
# is allowed to run before the controller terminates the workflow.

# Note that currently, workflows are marked Running and updated with a start time as soon as they
# are seen by the controller. What this means in practice, is that a workflow level timeout is
# typically relative to the submission time. In the future, workflows may support the notion of a
# priority queue so workflows can remain in a Pending state. When this is implemented, the
# activeDeadlineSeconds will be relative to the admittance of the workflow into the system, (when
# the workflow transitions from Pending to Running).
