## What is Argo Workflows?
Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition).

* Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container.
* Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
* Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo Workflows on Kubernetes.
* Run CI/CD pipelines natively on Kubernetes without configuring complex software development products.

Argo is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://cncf.io/) hosted project.

## Why Argo Workflows?
* Designed from the ground up for containers without the overhead and limitations of legacy VM and server-based environments.
* Cloud agnostic and can run on any Kubernetes cluster.
* Easily orchestrate highly parallel jobs on Kubernetes.
* Argo Workflows puts a cloud-scale supercomputer at your fingertips!

## Quickstart
```bash
kubectl create namespace argo
kubectl apply -n argo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```
