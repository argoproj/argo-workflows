# Argo - The Workflow Engine for Kubernetes

![Argo Image](argo.png)

## What is Argo?
Argo is an open source container-native workflow engine for getting work done on Kubernetes. Argo is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Customer Resource Definition).

* Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container.
  * Soon, you will also be able to define workflows as a dependency graph (DAG).
* Easily leverage Kubernetes to run compute intensive jobs like data processing or machine learning jobs in a fraction of the time using Argo workflows.
* Run rich CI/CD pipelines using Docker-in-Docker, built-in artifact management, secret management and native access to other Kubernetes resources.


## Why Argo?
* Argo is designed from the ground up for containers without the overhead and limitations of legacy VM and server-based environments.
* Argo is cloud agnostic and can run on any kubernetes cluster.
* Argo with Kubernetes puts a cloud-scale supercomputer at your fingertips.
* We want to make it as easy to run Argo workflows on Kubernetes as it is to run jobs on you laptop.

## Argo 2.0 Alpha 
Argo 2.0 is a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) which can run workflows using kubectl commands.
