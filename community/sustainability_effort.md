# Argo Workflows Sustainability Effort

Argo Workflows is seeking more community involvement and ultimately more [Reviewers and Approvers](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/blob/main/community/membership.md) to help keep it viable. 

We are trying an Incentive System in which contributors pledge a certain number of hours per week (average) to the project and in return have their PRs prioritized for review.

## Where is help needed?

Help is needed for:
* [reviewing PRs](#reviewing-PRs)
* [triaging](../docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#triaging-bugs) new bugs by prioritizing them with `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, and `P3` labels
* responding to questions in [Github Discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/discussions)
* responding to questions in [CNCF Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in the `#argo-workflows` and `#argo-wf-contributors` channels 
* releasing new versions

## Commitment

Argo Workflows has roles as described in the [Contributing](../docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#roles) document.
Any code contributor in a designated role or with an open Membership request can sign up to participate in this Incentive System.

Participants are expected to try to advance in roles.
There are different expectations depending on the role:
- Member and non-member: should average a minimum of 6 hours per week of either [authoring PRs](../docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#authoring-prs) or performing any activities listed above in the ["Where is help needed?"](#where-is-help-needed) section (where permissions allow)
  - Note that more time is required in this role in order to learn the codebase and processes to make sufficient progress
- Reviewer and above: should average a minimum of 2 hours per week performing any activities listed above in ["Where is help needed?"](#where-is-help-needed) section (where permissions allow)
  - Highest priority is to ensure that all PRs labeled `prioritized-review` [have an Assignee](#reviewing-prs)

Note that the hours per week listed above is an average over time; it's fine to have weeks of no activity so long as the average meets expectations.

Participants should join the [`#argo-wf-contributors`](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C0510EUH90V) Slack channel. They should also be invited to the private `#argo-wf-sustainability` channel.

### Reviewing PRs

First priority is to review any PRs which have the [`prioritized-review` label](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/labels/prioritized-review), meaning a participant of this system (verified by GitHub ID) either authored the PR or added the label to a PR that they did not author.
Each of these should have an Assignee: a Reviewer, Approver, or Lead who "owns" reviewing the PR.<br />
These PRs should be given an initial review within a week.
The Assignee should then respond to each question or requested modification from the author within a week.

Next, look for PRs with no Assignee. 

For general guidance regarding PR Reviews, see [the Contributing docs](../CONTRIBUTING.md#reviewing-prs).

### Authoring PRs

Participants can apply a `prioritized-review` label to any PRs they author and any PRs they feel are important. 
Use judgment when adding this label, so as to not overwhelm this system.
If you do not have permissions to add labels yet, you can request the label in the `#argo-wf-sustainability` channel.

If a PR has reached a week without an Assignee, you can request an assignment in the channel.
