# Argo Workflows Sustainability Effort

Argo Workflows is seeking more community involvement and ultimately more [Reviewers and Approvers](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/blob/main/community/membership.md) to help keep it viable. 

We are trying an Incentive System in which contributors pledge a certain number of hours per week (average) to the project and in return have their PRs prioritized for review.

## Where is help needed?

Help is needed for:
* [reviewing PRs](#reviewing-PRs)
* [triaging](../docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#triaging-bugs) new incoming bugs by prioritizing them with `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, and `P3` labels
* responding to questions in [Github Discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/discussions)
* responding to questions in [CNCF Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in the `#argo-workflows` and `#argo-wf-contributors` channels 

## Commitment

Argo Workflows has roles as described in the [Contributing](../docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#roles) document.
Any code contributor in a designated role or with an open Membership request can sign up to participate in this Incentive System.
To create a Membership request, create an Issue in the [argoproj](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj) repository as described in the [Membership](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/blob/main/community/membership.md) guide.

Participants are expected to try to advance in roles.
There are different expectations depending on the role:
- Member and below: should average a minimum of 8 hours per week of either [authoring PRs](../docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#authoring-prs) or performing any activities listed above in the ["Where is help needed?"](#where-is-help-needed) section
  - Note that more time is required in this role in order to learn the codebase and processes to make sufficient progress
- Reviewer and above: should average a minimum of 2 hours per week doing any of the activities listed above in ["Where is help needed?"](#where-is-help-needed) section (highest priority is to ensure that all [`prioritized` PRs](#authoring-prs) have an Assignee)

Note that the hours per week listed above is an average over time; it's fine to have weeks of no activity so long as the average meets expectations.

Participants should join the [#argo-wf-contributors](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C0510EUH90V) slack channel.

### Reviewing PRs

First priority is to review any PRs which have the `prioritized` label, meaning they were authored by a participant of this system (verified by GitHub ID).
Each of these should have an Assignee: a Reviewer, Approver, or Lead who "owns" reviewing the PR.<br />
These PRs should be given an initial review within a week.
The Assignee should then respond to each question or requested modification from the author within a week.

Next, look for PRs with no Assignee. 

If a Reviewer is the Assignee, then once they have approved the PR, they should request a review from one or more Approvers.

### Authoring PRs

Participants can apply a `prioritized` label to any PRs they author.
