# Argo Community

Welcome to the Argo community!

Argo is an open, community driven project to make it easy to use Kubernetes for getting useful work done.
The [Argoproj Community README](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/blob/main/community/README.md) describes the organizational structure and governance of Argo projects including roles, responsibilities, and processes.

## Argo Workflows Sustainability Effort

Argo Workflows is seeking more community involvement and ultimately more [Reviewers and Approvers](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/blob/main/community/membership.md) to help keep it viable.
Please see [Sustainability Effort](sustainability_effort.md) for more information.
