There are two Deployments: Workflow Controller and Argo Server. The former does all of the reconciling, and the latter serves the API. Note that the Controller can be used stand alone. The reconciliation code for the WorkflowController can be found in workflow/controller/controller.go . The Argo Server opens up an HTTP(S) listener at server/apiserver/argoserver.go . Argo Workflow Overview \u00b6 The diagram below provides a little more detail as far as namespaces. The Workflow Controller and Argo Server both run in the argo namespace. Assuming Argo Workflows was installed as a Cluster Install or as a Managed Namespace Install (described here ), the Workflows and the Pods generated from them run in a separate namespace. The internals of a Pod are also shown. Each Step and each DAG Task cause a Pod to be generated, and each of these is composed of 3 containers: main container runs the Image that the user indicated, where the argoexec utility is volume mounted and serves as the main command which calls the configured Command as a sub-process init container is an InitContainer , fetching artifacts and parameters and making them available to the main container wait container performs tasks that are needed for clean up, including saving off parameters and artifacts Look in cmd/argoexec for this code. Workflow controller architecture \u00b6 The following diagram shows the process for reconciliation, whereby a set of worker goroutines process the Workflows which have been added to a Workflow queue based on adds and updates to Workflows and Workflow Pods. Note that in addition to the Informers shown, there are Informers for the other CRDs that Argo Workflows uses as well. You can find this code in workflow/controller/controller.go . Note that the controller only ever processes a single Workflow at a time. Various configurations for Argo UI and Argo Server \u00b6 The top diagram below shows what happens if you run \"make start UI=true\" locally (recommended if you need the UI during local development). This runs a React application ( Webpack HTTP server) locally which serves the index.html and typescript files from port 8080. From the typescript code there are calls made to the back end API (Argo Server) at port 2746. The Webpack HTTP server is configured for hot reload, meaning the UI will update automatically based on local code changes. The second diagram is an alternative approach for rare occasions that the React files are broken and you're doing local development. In this case, everything is served from the Argo Server at port 2746. The third diagram shows how things are configured for a Kubernetes environment.

This document describes how to set up Argo Workflows and Argo CD so that Argo Workflows uses Argo CD's Dex server for authentication. To start Argo Server with SSO \u00b6 Firstly, configure the settings workflow-controller-configmap.yaml with the correct OAuth 2 values. If working towards an OIDC configuration the Argo CD project has guides on its similar (though different) process for setting up OIDC providers. It also includes examples for specific providers. The main difference is that the Argo CD docs mention that their callback address endpoint is /auth/callback . For Argo Workflows, the default format is /oauth2/callback as shown in this comment in the default values.yaml file in the helm chart. Next, create the Kubernetes secrets for holding the OAuth2 client-id and client-secret . You may refer to the kubernetes documentation on Managing secrets . For example by using kubectl with literals: kubectl create secret -n argo generic client-id-secret \\ --from-literal = client-id-key = foo kubectl create secret -n argo generic client-secret-secret \\ --from-literal = client-secret-key = bar Then, start the Argo Server using the SSO auth mode : argo server --auth-mode sso --auth-mode ... Token Revocation \u00b6 v2.12 and after As of v2.12 we issue a JWE token for users rather than give them the ID token from your OAuth2 provider. This token is opaque and has a longer expiry time (10h by default). The token encryption key is automatically generated by the Argo Server and stored in a Kubernetes secret name sso . You can revoke all tokens by deleting the encryption key and restarting the Argo Server (so it generates a new key). kubectl delete secret sso Warning The old key will be in the memory the any running Argo Server, and they will therefore accept and user with token encrypted using the old key. Every Argo Server MUST be restarted. All users will need to log in again. Sorry. SSO RBAC \u00b6 v2.12 and after You can optionally add RBAC to SSO. This allows you to give different users different access levels. Except for client auth mode, all users of the Argo Server must ultimately use a service account. So we allow you to define rules that map a user (maybe using their OIDC groups) to a service account in the same namespace as argo server by annotating the service account. To allow service accounts to manage resources in other namespaces create a role and role binding in the target namespace. RBAC config is installation-level, so any changes will need to be made by the team that installed Argo. Many complex rules will be burdensome on that team. Firstly, enable the rbac: setting in workflow-controller-configmap.yaml . You almost certainly want to be able to configure RBAC using groups, so add scopes: to the SSO settings: sso : # ... scopes : - groups rbac : enabled : true Note Not all OIDC providers support the groups scope. Please speak to your provider about their options. To configure a service account to be used, annotate it: apiVersion : v1 kind : ServiceAccount metadata : name : admin-user annotations : # The rule is an expression used to determine if this service account # should be used. # * `groups` - an array of the OIDC groups # * `iss` - the issuer (\"argo-server\") # * `sub` - the subject (typically the username) # Must evaluate to a boolean. # If you want an account to be the default to use, this rule can be \"true\". # Details of the expression language are available in # https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/master/docs/Language-Definition.md. workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule : \"'admin' in groups\" # The precedence is used to determine which service account to use whe # Precedence is an integer. It may be negative. If omitted, it defaults to \"0\". # Numerically higher values have higher precedence (not lower, which maybe # counter-intuitive to you). # If two rules match and have the same precedence, then which one used will # be arbitrary. workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule-precedence : \"1\" If no rule matches, we deny the user access. Tip: You'll probably want to configure a default account to use if no other rule matches, e.g. a read-only account, you can do this as follows: metadata : name : read-only annotations : workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule : \"true\" workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule-precedence : \"0\" The precedence must be the lowest of all your service accounts. As of Kubernetes v1.24, secrets for a service account token are no longer automatically created. Therefore, service account secrets for SSO RBAC must be created manually. See Manually create secrets for detailed instructions. SSO RBAC Namespace Delegation \u00b6 v3.3 and after You can optionally configure RBAC SSO per namespace. Typically, on organization has a Kubernetes cluster and a central team (the owner of the cluster) manages the cluster. Along with this, there are multiple namespaces which are owned by individual teams. This feature would help namespace owners to define RBAC for their own namespace. The feature is currently in beta. To enable the feature, set env variable SSO_DELEGATE_RBAC_TO_NAMESPACE=true in your argo-server deployment. Recommended usage \u00b6 Configure a default account in the installation namespace that allows access to all users of your organization. This service account allows a user to login to the cluster. You could optionally add a workflow read-only role and role-binding. apiVersion : v1 kind : ServiceAccount metadata : name : user-default-login annotations : workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule : \"true\" workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule-precedence : \"0\" Note All users MUST map to a cluster service account (such as the one above) before a namespace service account can apply. Now, for the namespace that you own, configure a service account that allows members of your team to perform operations in your namespace. Make sure that the precedence of the namespace service account is higher than the precedence of the login service account. Create an appropriate role for this service account and bind it with a role-binding. apiVersion : v1 kind : ServiceAccount metadata : name : my-namespace-read-write-user namespace : my-namespace annotations : workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule : \"'my-team' in groups\" workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule-precedence : \"1\" With this configuration, when a user is logged in via SSO, makes a request in my-namespace , and the rbac-rule matches, this service account allows the user to perform that operation. If no service account matches in the namespace, the first service account ( user-default-login ) and its associated role will be used to perform the operation. SSO Login Time \u00b6 v2.12 and after By default, your SSO session will expire after 10 hours. You can change this by adding a sessionExpiry to your workflow-controller-configmap.yaml under the SSO heading. sso : # Expiry defines how long your login is valid for in hours. (optional) sessionExpiry : 240h Custom claims \u00b6 v3.1.4 and after If your OIDC provider provides groups information with a claim name other than groups , you could configure config-map to specify custom claim name for groups. Argo now arbitrary custom claims and any claim can be used for expr eval . However, since group information is displayed in UI, it still needs to be an array of strings with group names as elements. The customClaim in this case will be mapped to groups key and we can use the same key groups for evaluating our expressions sso : # Specify custom claim name for OIDC groups. customGroupClaimName : argo_groups If your OIDC provider provides groups information only using the user-info endpoint (e.g. Okta), you could configure userInfoPath to specify the user info endpoint that contains the groups claim. sso : userInfoPath : /oauth2/v1/userinfo Example Expression \u00b6 # assuming customClaimGroupName: argo_groups workflows.argoproj.io/rbac-rule: \"'argo_admins' in groups\"","title":"Argo Server SSO"},{"location":"argo-server-sso/#argo-server-sso","text":"v2.9 and after It is possible to use Dex for authentication.

This document describes the second option in more detail. The pattern \u00b6 The pattern involves two steps - the first step is a short-running step that triggers a long-running job outside Argo (e.g. an HTTP submission), and the second step is a Suspend step that suspends workflow execution and is ultimately either resumed or stopped (i.e. failed) via a call to the Argo API when the job outside Argo succeeds or fails.

Configuring AWS S3 \u00b6 Create your bucket and access keys for the bucket. AWS access keys have the same permissions as the user they are associated with. In particular, you cannot create access keys with reduced scope. If you want to limit the permissions for an access key, you will need to create a user with just the permissions you want to associate with the access key. Otherwise, you can just create an access key using your existing user account. $ export mybucket = bucket249 $ cat > policy.json <<EOF { \"Version\":\"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\":[ { \"Effect\":\"Allow\", \"Action\":[ \"s3:PutObject\", \"s3:GetObject\", \"s3:DeleteObject\" ], \"Resource\":\"arn:aws:s3:::$mybucket/*\" }, { \"Effect\":\"Allow\", \"Action\":[ \"s3:ListBucket\" ], \"Resource\":\"arn:aws:s3:::$mybucket\" } ] } EOF $ aws s3 mb s3:// $mybucket [ --region xxx ] $ aws iam create-user --user-name $mybucket -user $ aws iam put-user-policy --user-name $mybucket -user --policy-name $mybucket -policy --policy-document file://policy.json $ aws iam create-access-key --user-name $mybucket -user > access-key.json If you do not have Artifact Garbage Collection configured, you should remove s3:DeleteObject from the list of Actions above.

Otherwise, you must specify a bucket region in your workflow configuration. { \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" :[ \"s3:GetBucketLocation\" ], \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:s3:::*\" } ... AWS S3 IRSA \u00b6 If you wish to use S3 IRSA instead of passing in an accessKey and secretKey , you need to annotate the service account of both the running workflow (in order to save logs/artifacts) and the argo-server pod (in order to retrieve the logs/artifacts). apiVersion : v1 kind : ServiceAccount metadata : annotations : eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn : arn:aws:iam::012345678901:role/mybucket name : myserviceaccount namespace : mynamespace Configuring GCS (Google Cloud Storage) \u00b6 Create a bucket from the GCP Console ( https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser ). There are 2 ways to configure a Google Cloud Storage. Through Native GCS APIs \u00b6 Create and download a Google Cloud service account key. Create a kubernetes secret to store the key. Configure gcs artifact as following in the yaml. artifacts : - name : message path : /tmp/message gcs : bucket : my-bucket-name key : path/in/bucket # serviceAccountKeySecret is a secret selector. # It references the k8s secret named 'my-gcs-credentials'. # This secret is expected to have have the key 'serviceAccountKey', # containing the base64 encoded credentials # to the bucket. # # If it's running on GKE and Workload Identity is used, # serviceAccountKeySecret is not needed. serviceAccountKeySecret : name : my-gcs-credentials key : serviceAccountKey If it's a GKE cluster, and Workload Identity is configured, there's no need to create the service account key and store it as a Kubernetes secret, serviceAccountKeySecret is also not needed in this case. Please follow the link to configure Workload Identity ( https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity ). Use S3 APIs \u00b6 Enable S3 compatible access and create an access key. Note that S3 compatible access is on a per project rather than per bucket basis. Navigate to Storage > Settings ( https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings ). Enable interoperability access if needed. Create a new key if needed. Configure s3 artifact as following example. artifacts : - name : my-output-artifact path : /my-output-artifact s3 : endpoint : storage.googleapis.com bucket : my-gcs-bucket-name # NOTE that, by default, all output artifacts are automatically tarred and # gzipped before saving. So as a best practice, .tgz or .tar.gz # should be incorporated into the key name so the resulting file # has an accurate file extension. key : path/in/bucket/my-output-artifact.tgz accessKeySecret : name : my-gcs-s3-credentials key : accessKey secretKeySecret : name : my-gcs-s3-credentials key : secretKey Configuring Alibaba Cloud OSS (Object Storage Service) \u00b6 Create your bucket and access key for the bucket. Suggest to limit the permission for the access key, you will need to create a user with just the permissions you want to associate with the access key. Otherwise, you can just create an access key using your existing user account. Setup Alibaba Cloud CLI and follow the steps to configure the artifact storage for your workflow: $ export mybucket = bucket-workflow-artifect $ export myregion = cn-zhangjiakou $ # limit permission to read/write the bucket. $ cat > policy.json <<EOF { \"Version\": \"1\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"oss:PutObject\", \"oss:GetObject\" ], \"Resource\": \"acs:oss:*:*:$mybucket/*\" } ] } EOF $ # create bucket. $ aliyun oss mb oss:// $mybucket --region $myregion $ # show endpoint of bucket. $ aliyun oss stat oss:// $mybucket $ #create a ram user to access bucket. $ aliyun ram CreateUser --UserName $mybucket -user $ # create ram policy with the limit permission. $ aliyun ram CreatePolicy --PolicyName $mybucket -policy --PolicyDocument \" $( cat policy.json ) \" $ # attch ram policy to the ram user. $ aliyun ram AttachPolicyToUser --UserName $mybucket -user --PolicyName $mybucket -policy --PolicyType Custom $ # create access key and secret key for the ram user. $ aliyun ram CreateAccessKey --UserName $mybucket -user > access-key.json $ # create secret in demo namespace, replace demo with your namespace. $ kubectl create secret generic $mybucket -credentials -n demo \\ --from-literal \"accessKey= $( cat access-key.json | jq -r .AccessKey.AccessKeyId ) \" \\ --from-literal \"secretKey= $( cat access-key.json | jq -r .AccessKey.AccessKeySecret ) \" $ # create configmap to config default artifact for a namespace. $ cat > default-artifact-repository.yaml << EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: # If you want to use this config map by default, name it \"artifact-repositories\".

Note that you'll need to set additional permission for your OSS account to create new buckets. Configuring Azure Blob Storage \u00b6 Create an Azure Storage account and a container within that account. There are a number of ways to accomplish this, including the Azure Portal or the CLI . Retrieve the blob service endpoint for the storage account. For example: az storage account show -n mystorageaccountname --query 'primaryEndpoints.blob' -otsv Retrieve the access key for the storage account. For example: az storage account keys list -n mystorageaccountname --query '[0].value' -otsv Create a kubernetes secret to hold the storage account key. For example: kubectl create secret generic my-azure-storage-credentials \\ --from-literal \"account-access-key= $( az storage account keys list -n mystorageaccountname --query '[0].value' -otsv ) \" Configure azure artifact as following in the yaml. artifacts : - name : message path : /tmp/message azure : endpoint : https://mystorageaccountname.blob.core.windows.net container : my-container-name blob : path/in/container # accountKeySecret is a secret selector. # It references the k8s secret named 'my-azure-storage-credentials'. # This secret is expected to have have the key 'account-access-key', # containing the base64 encoded credentials to the storage account. # # If a managed identity has been assigned to the machines running the # workflow (e.g., https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-managed-identity) # then accountKeySecret is not needed, and useSDKCreds should be # set to true instead: # useSDKCreds: true accountKeySecret : name : my-azure-storage-credentials key : account-access-key If useSDKCreds is set to true , then the accountKeySecret value is not used and authentication with Azure will be attempted using a DefaultAzureCredential instead. Configure the Default Artifact Repository \u00b6 In order for Argo to use your artifact repository, you can configure it as the default repository. Edit the workflow-controller config map with the correct endpoint and access/secret keys for your repository. S3 compatible artifact repository bucket (such as AWS, GCS, MinIO, and Alibaba Cloud OSS) \u00b6 Use the endpoint corresponding to your provider: AWS: s3.amazonaws.com GCS: storage.googleapis.com MinIO: my-minio-endpoint.default:9000 Alibaba Cloud OSS: oss-cn-hangzhou-zmf.aliyuncs.com The key is name of the object in the bucket The accessKeySecret and secretKeySecret are secret selectors that reference the specified kubernetes secret. The secret is expected to have the keys accessKey and secretKey , containing the base64 encoded credentials to the bucket. For AWS, the accessKeySecret and secretKeySecret correspond to AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY respectively. EC2 provides a meta-data API via which applications using the AWS SDK may assume IAM roles associated with the instance. If you are running argo on EC2 and the instance role allows access to your S3 bucket, you can configure the workflow step pods to assume the role. To do so, simply omit the accessKeySecret and secretKeySecret fields. For GCS, the accessKeySecret and secretKeySecret for S3 compatible access can be obtained from the GCP Console. Note that S3 compatible access is on a per project rather than per bucket basis. Navigate to Storage > Settings ( https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings ). Enable interoperability access if needed. Create a new key if needed. For MinIO, the accessKeySecret and secretKeySecret naturally correspond the AccessKey and SecretKey . For Alibaba Cloud OSS, the accessKeySecret and secretKeySecret corresponds to accessKeyID and accessKeySecret respectively. Example: $ kubectl edit configmap workflow-controller-configmap -n argo # assumes argo was installed in the argo namespace ... data: artifactRepository: | s3: bucket: my-bucket keyFormat: prefix/in/bucket #optional endpoint: my-minio-endpoint.default:9000 #AWS => s3.amazonaws.com; GCS => storage.googleapis.com insecure: true #omit for S3/GCS.

Note that you can specify a keyFormat . Google Cloud Storage (GCS) \u00b6 Argo also can use native GCS APIs to access a Google Cloud Storage bucket. serviceAccountKeySecret references to a Kubernetes secret which stores a Google Cloud service account key to access the bucket. Example: $ kubectl edit configmap workflow-controller-configmap -n argo # assumes argo was installed in the argo namespace ... data: artifactRepository: | gcs: bucket: my-bucket keyFormat: prefix/in/bucket/ {{ workflow.name }} / {{ pod.name }} #it should reference workflow variables, such as \"{{workflow.name}}/{{pod.name}}\" serviceAccountKeySecret: name: my-gcs-credentials key: serviceAccountKey Azure Blob Storage \u00b6 Argo can use native Azure APIs to access a Azure Blob Storage container. accountKeySecret references to a Kubernetes secret which stores an Azure Blob Storage account shared key to access the container. Example: $ kubectl edit configmap workflow-controller-configmap -n argo # assumes argo was installed in the argo namespace ... data: artifactRepository: | azure: container: my-container blobNameFormat: prefix/in/container #optional, it could reference workflow variables, such as \"{{workflow.name}}/{{pod.name}}\" accountKeySecret: name: my-azure-storage-credentials key: account-access-key Accessing Non-Default Artifact Repositories \u00b6 This section shows how to access artifacts from non-default artifact repositories.

This mean that even though the container is doing no useful work, it is still consuming resources and you're still getting billed for them. If your requests are small, this won't be a problem. If your requests are large, set the resource requests so the sum total is the most you'll need at once. Example A: a simple sequence e.g. a -> b -> c a needs 1Gi memory b needs 2Gi memory c needs 1Gi memory Then you know you need only a maximum of 2Gi. You could set as follows: a requests 512Mi memory b requests 1Gi memory c requests 512Mi memory The total is 2Gi, which is enough for b . We're all good. Example B: Diamond DAG e.g. a diamond a -> b -> d and a -> c -> d , i.e. b and c run at the same time. a needs 1000 cpu b needs 2000 cpu c needs 1000 cpu d needs 1000 cpu I know that b and c will run at the same time. So I need to make sure the total is 3000. a requests 500 cpu b requests 1000 cpu c requests 1000 cpu d requests 500 cpu The total is 3000, which is enough for b + c . We're all good. Example B: Lopsided requests, e.g. a -> b where a is cheap and b is expensive a needs 100 cpu, 1Mi memory, runs for 10h b needs 8Ki GPU, 100 Gi memory, 200 Ki GPU, runs for 5m Can you see the problem here? a only has small requests, but the container set will use the total of all requests.

Copying artifacts to and from storage outside of a cluster can be expensive. The correct choice is dependent on what your artifact storage provider is vs. what volume they are using. For example, we believe it may be more expensive to allocate and delete a new block storage volume (AWS EBS, GCP persistent disk) every workflow using the PVC feature, than it is to upload and download some small files to object storage (AWS S3, GCP cloud storage). On the other hand if you are using a NFS volume shared between all your workflows with large artifacts, that might be cheaper than the data transfer and storage costs of object storage. Consider: Data transfer costs (upload/download vs. copying) Data storage costs (object storage vs. volume) Requirement for parallel access to data (NFS vs. block storage vs. artifact) When using volume claims, consider configuring Volume Claim GC .

You should delete workflows once they are no longer needed, or enable a Workflow Archive and you can still view them after they are removed from Kubernetes. Limit the total number of workflows using: Active Deadline Seconds - terminate running workflows that do not complete in a set time. This will make sure workflows do not run forever.

They are designed to be converted from Workflow easily and to mimic the same options as Kubernetes CronJob . In essence, CronWorkflow = Workflow + some specific cron options. CronWorkflow Spec \u00b6 An example CronWorkflow spec would look like: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : CronWorkflow metadata : name : test-cron-wf spec : schedule : \"* * * * *\" concurrencyPolicy : \"Replace\" startingDeadlineSeconds : 0 workflowSpec : entrypoint : whalesay templates : - name : whalesay container : image : alpine:3.6 command : [ sh , -c ] args : [ \"date; sleep 90\" ] workflowSpec and workflowMetadata \u00b6 CronWorkflow.spec.workflowSpec is the same type as Workflow.spec and serves as a template for Workflow objects that are created from it. Everything under this spec will be converted to a Workflow . The resulting Workflow name will be a generated name based on the CronWorkflow name. In this example it could be something like test-cron-wf-tj6fe . CronWorkflow.spec.workflowMetadata can be used to add labels and annotations . CronWorkflow Options \u00b6 Option Name Default Value Description schedule None, must be provided Schedule at which the Workflow will be run. E.g. 5 4 * * * timezone Machine timezone Timezone during which the Workflow will be run from the IANA timezone standard, e.g. America/Los_Angeles suspend false If true Workflow scheduling will not occur. Can be set from the CLI, GitOps, or directly concurrencyPolicy Allow Policy that determines what to do if multiple Workflows are scheduled at the same time. Available options: Allow : allow all, Replace : remove all old before scheduling a new, Forbid : do not allow any new while there are old startingDeadlineSeconds 0 Number of seconds after the last successful run during which a missed Workflow will be run successfulJobsHistoryLimit 3 Number of successful Workflows that will be persisted at a time failedJobsHistoryLimit 1 Number of failed Workflows that will be persisted at a time Cron Schedule Syntax \u00b6 The cron scheduler uses the standard cron syntax, as documented on Wikipedia . More detailed documentation for the specific library used is documented here . Crash Recovery \u00b6 If the workflow-controller crashes (and hence the CronWorkflow controller), there are some options you can set to ensure that CronWorkflows that would have been scheduled while the controller was down can still run. Mainly startingDeadlineSeconds can be set to specify the maximum number of seconds past the last successful run of a CronWorkflow during which a missed run will still be executed. For example, if a CronWorkflow that runs every minute is last run at 12:05:00, and the controller crashes between 12:05:55 and 12:06:05, then the expected execution time of 12:06:00 would be missed. However, if startingDeadlineSeconds is set to a value greater than 65 (the amount of time passing between the last scheduled run time of 12:05:00 and the current controller restart time of 12:06:05), then a single instance of the CronWorkflow will be executed exactly at 12:06:05. Currently only a single instance will be executed as a result of setting startingDeadlineSeconds . This setting can also be configured in tandem with concurrencyPolicy to achieve more fine-tuned control. Daylight Saving \u00b6 Daylight Saving (DST) is taken into account when using timezone. This means that, depending on the local time of the scheduled job, argo will schedule the workflow once, twice, or not at all when the clock moves forward or back. For example, with timezone set at America/Los_Angeles , we have daylight saving +1 hour (DST start) at 2020-03-08 02:00:00: Note: The schedules between 02:00 a.m. to 02:59 a.m. were skipped on Mar 8th due to the clock being moved forward: cron sequence workflow execution time 59 1 ** * 1 2020-03-08 01:59:00 -0800 PST 2 2020-03-09 01:59:00 -0700 PDT 3 2020-03-10 01:59:00 -0700 PDT 0 2 ** * 1 2020-03-09 02:00:00 -0700 PDT 2 2020-03-10 02:00:00 -0700 PDT 3 2020-03-11 02:00:00 -0700 PDT 1 2 ** * 1 2020-03-09 02:01:00 -0700 PDT 2 2020-03-10 02:01:00 -0700 PDT 3 2020-03-11 02:01:00 -0700 PDT -1 hour (DST end) at 2020-11-01 02:00:00: Note: the schedules between 01:00 a.m. to 01:59 a.m. were triggered twice on Nov 1st due to the clock being set back: cron sequence workflow execution time 59 1 ** * 1 2020-11-01 01:59:00 -0700 PDT 2 2020-11-01 01:59:00 -0800 PST 3 2020-11-02 01:59:00 -0800 PST 0 2 ** * 1 2020-11-01 02:00:00 -0800 PST 2 2020-11-02 02:00:00 -0800 PST 3 2020-11-03 02:00:00 -0800 PST 1 2 ** * 1 2020-11-01 02:01:00 -0800 PST 2 2020-11-02 02:01:00 -0800 PST 3 2020-11-03 02:01:00 -0800 PST Managing CronWorkflow \u00b6 CLI \u00b6 CronWorkflow can be created from the CLI by using basic commands: $ argo cron create cron.yaml Name: test-cron-wf Namespace: argo Created: Mon Nov 18 10 :17:06 -0800 ( now ) Schedule: * * * * * Suspended: false StartingDeadlineSeconds: 0 ConcurrencyPolicy: Forbid $ argo cron list NAME AGE LAST RUN SCHEDULE SUSPENDED test-cron-wf 49s N/A * * * * * false # some time passes $ argo cron list NAME AGE LAST RUN SCHEDULE SUSPENDED test-cron-wf 56s 2s * * * * * false $ argo cron get test-cron-wf Name: test-cron-wf Namespace: argo Created: Wed Oct 28 07 :19:02 -0600 ( 23 hours ago ) Schedule: * * * * * Suspended: false StartingDeadlineSeconds: 0 ConcurrencyPolicy: Replace LastScheduledTime: Thu Oct 29 06 :51:00 -0600 ( 11 minutes ago ) NextScheduledTime: Thu Oct 29 13 :03:00 +0000 ( 32 seconds from now ) Active Workflows: test-cron-wf-rt4nf Note : NextScheduledRun assumes that the workflow-controller uses UTC as its timezone kubectl \u00b6 Using kubectl apply -f and kubectl get cwf Back-Filling Days \u00b6 See cron backfill .

Events sent to that can be any JSON data. These events can submit workflow templates or cluster workflow templates . You may also wish to read about webhooks . Authentication and Security \u00b6 Clients wanting to send events to the endpoint need an access token . It is only possible to submit workflow templates your access token has access to: example role . Example (note the trailing slash): curl https://localhost:2746/api/v1/events/argo/ \\ -H \"Authorization: $ARGO_TOKEN \" \\ -d '{\"message\": \"hello\"}' With a discriminator : curl https://localhost:2746/api/v1/events/argo/my-discriminator \\ -H \"Authorization: $ARGO_TOKEN \" \\ -d '{\"message\": \"hello\"}' The event endpoint will always return in under 10 seconds because the event will be queued and processed asynchronously. This means you will not be notified synchronously of failure. It will return a failure (503) if the event processing queue is full. Processing Order Events may not always be processed in the order they are received. Workflow Template triggered by the event \u00b6 Before the binding between an event and a workflow template, you must create the workflow template that you want to trigger. The following one takes in input the \"message\" parameter specified into the API call body, passed through the WorkflowEventBinding parameters section, and finally resolved here as the message of the whalesay image. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : WorkflowTemplate metadata : name : my-wf-tmple namespace : argo spec : templates : - name : main inputs : parameters : - name : message value : \"{{workflow.parameters.message}}\" container : image : docker/whalesay:latest command : [ cowsay ] args : [ \"{{inputs.parameters.message}}\" ] entrypoint : main Submitting A Workflow From A Workflow Template \u00b6 A workflow template will be submitted (i.e. workflow created from it) and that can be created using parameters from the event itself. The following example will be triggered by an event with \"message\" in the payload. That message will be used as an argument for the created workflow. Note that the name of the meta-data header \"x-argo-e2e\" is lowercase in the selector to match. Incoming header names are converted to lowercase. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : WorkflowEventBinding metadata : name : event-consumer spec : event : # metadata header name must be lowercase to match in selector selector : payload.message != \"\" && metadata[\"x-argo-e2e\"] == [\"true\"] && discriminator == \"my-discriminator\" submit : workflowTemplateRef : name : my-wf-tmple arguments : parameters : - name : message valueFrom : event : payload.message Please, notice that workflowTemplateRef refers to a template with the name my-wf-tmple , this template has to be created before the triggering of the event. After that you have to apply the above explained WorkflowEventBinding (in this example this is called event-template.yml ) to realize the binding between Workflow Template and event (you can use kubectl to do that): kubectl apply -f event-template.yml Finally you can trigger the creation of your first parametrized workflow template, by using the following call: Event: curl $ARGO_SERVER /api/v1/events/argo/my-discriminator \\ -H \"Authorization: $ARGO_TOKEN \" \\ -H \"X-Argo-E2E: true\" \\ -d '{\"message\": \"hello events\"}' Malformed Expressions If the expression is malformed, this is logged. It is not visible in logs or the UI. Customizing the Workflow Meta-Data \u00b6 You can customize the name of the submitted workflow as well as add annotations and labels. This is done by adding a metadata object to the submit object. Normally the name of the workflow created from an event is simply the name of the template with a time-stamp appended. This can be customized by setting the name in the metadata object. Annotations and labels are added in the same fashion. All the values for the name, annotations and labels are treated as expressions (see below for details). The metadata object is the same metadata type as on all Kubernetes resources and as such is parsed in the same manner. It is best to enclose the expression in single quotes to avoid any problems when submitting the event binding to Kubernetes. This is an example snippet of how to set the name, annotations and labels. This is based on the workflow binding from above, and the first event. submit : metadata : annotations : anAnnotation : 'event.payload.message' name : 'event.payload.message + \"-world\"' labels : someLabel : '\"literal string\"' This will result in the workflow being named \"hello-world\" instead of my-wf-tmple-<timestamp> . There will be an extra label with the key someLabel and a value of \"literal string\". There will also be an extra annotation with the key anAnnotation and a value of \"hello\" Be careful when setting the name. If the name expression evaluates to that of a currently existing workflow, the new workflow will fail to submit. The name, annotation and label expression must evaluate to a string and follow the normal Kubernetes naming requirements . Event Expression Syntax and the Event Expression Environment \u00b6 Event expressions are expressions that are evaluated over the event expression environment . Expression Syntax \u00b6 Because the endpoint accepts any JSON data, it is the user's responsibility to write a suitable expression to correctly filter the events they are interested in. Therefore, DO NOT assume the existence of any fields, and guard against them using a nil check. Learn more about expression syntax . Expression Environment \u00b6 The event environment contains: payload the event payload. metadata event meta-data, including HTTP headers. discriminator the discriminator from the URL. Payload \u00b6 This is the JSON payload of the event. Example: payload.repository.clone_url == \"http://gihub.com/argoproj/argo\" Meta-Data \u00b6 Meta-data is data about the event, this includes headers : Headers \u00b6 HTTP header names are lowercase and only include those that have x- as their prefix. Their values are lists, not single values.

Typically, it should be empty and ignored. Example: discriminator == \"my-discriminator\" High-Availability \u00b6 Run Minimum 2 Replicas You MUST run a minimum of two Argo Server replicas if you do not want to lose events. If you are processing large numbers of events, you may need to scale up the Argo Server to handle them. By default, a single Argo Server can be processing 64 events before the endpoint will start returning 503 errors. Vertically you can: Increase the size of the event operation queue --event-operation-queue-size (good for temporary event bursts).

A Simple Python Plugin \u00b6 Let's make a Python plugin that prints \"hello\" each time the workflow is operated on. We need the following: Plugins enabled (see above). A HTTP server that will be run as a sidecar to the main container and will respond to RPC HTTP requests from the executor with this API contract . A plugin.yaml configuration file, that is turned into a config map so the controller can discover the plugin. A template executor plugin services HTTP POST requests on /api/v1/template.execute : curl http://localhost:4355/api/v1/template.execute -d \\ '{ \"workflow\": { \"metadata\": { \"name\": \"my-wf\" } }, \"template\": { \"name\": \"my-tmpl\", \"inputs\": {}, \"outputs\": {}, \"plugin\": { \"hello\": {} } } }' # ... HTTP/1.1 200 OK { \"node\" : { \"phase\" : \"Succeeded\" , \"message\" : \"Hello template!\" } } Tip: The port number can be anything, but must not conflict with other plugins. Don't use common ports such as 80, 443, 8080, 8081, 8443. If you plan to publish your plugin, choose a random port number under 10,000 and create a PR to add your plugin. If not, use a port number greater than 10,000. We'll need to create a script that starts a HTTP server. Save this as server.py : import json from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler , HTTPServer with open ( \"/var/run/argo/token\" ) as f : token = f . read () . strip () class Plugin ( BaseHTTPRequestHandler ): def args ( self ): return json . loads ( self . rfile . read ( int ( self . headers . get ( 'Content-Length' )))) def reply ( self , reply ): self . send_response ( 200 ) self . end_headers () self . wfile . write ( json . dumps ( reply ) . encode ( \"UTF-8\" )) def forbidden ( self ): self . send_response ( 403 ) self . end_headers () def unsupported ( self ): self . send_response ( 404 ) self . end_headers () def do_POST ( self ): if self . headers . get ( \"Authorization\" ) != \"Bearer \" + token : self . forbidden () elif self . path == '/api/v1/template.execute' : args = self . args () if 'hello' in args [ 'template' ] . get ( 'plugin' , {}): self . reply ( { 'node' : { 'phase' : 'Succeeded' , 'message' : 'Hello template!' , 'outputs' : { 'parameters' : [{ 'name' : 'foo' , 'value' : 'bar' }]}}}) else : self . reply ({}) else : self . unsupported () if __name__ == '__main__' : httpd = HTTPServer (( '' , 4355 ), Plugin ) httpd . serve_forever () Tip : Plugins can be written in any language you can run as a container. Python is convenient because you can embed the script in the container. Some things to note here: You only need to implement the calls you need. Return 404 and it won't be called again. The path is the RPC method name. You should check that the Authorization header contains the same value as /var/run/argo/token . Return 403 if not The request body contains the template's input parameters. The response body may contain the node's result, including the phase (e.g. \"Succeeded\" or \"Failed\") and a message. If the response is {} , then the plugin is saying it cannot execute the plugin template, e.g. it is a Slack plugin, but the template is a Tekton job. If the status code is 404, then the plugin will not be called again. If you save the file as server.* , it will be copied to the sidecar container's args field. This is useful for building self-contained plugins in scripting languages like Python or Node.JS. Next, create a manifest named plugin.yaml : apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : ExecutorPlugin metadata : name : hello spec : sidecar : container : command : - python - -u # disables output buffering - -c image : python:alpine3.6 name : hello-executor-plugin ports : - containerPort : 4355 securityContext : runAsNonRoot : true runAsUser : 65534 # nobody resources : requests : memory : \"64Mi\" cpu : \"250m\" limits : memory : \"128Mi\" cpu : \"500m\" Build and install as follows: argo executor-plugin build . kubectl -n argo apply -f hello-executor-plugin-configmap.yaml Check your controller logs: level=info msg=\"Executor plugin added\" name=hello-controller-plugin Run this workflow. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : hello- spec : entrypoint : main templates : - name : main plugin : hello : { } You'll see the workflow complete successfully. Discovery \u00b6 When a workflow is run, plugins are loaded from: The workflow's namespace. The Argo installation namespace (typically argo ). If two plugins have the same name, only the one in the workflow's namespace is loaded. Secrets \u00b6 If you interact with a third-party system, you'll need access to secrets. Don't put them in plugin.yaml . Use a secret: spec : sidecar : container : env : - name : URL valueFrom : secretKeyRef : name : slack-executor-plugin key : URL Refer to the Kubernetes Secret documentation for secret best practices and security considerations. Resources, Security Context \u00b6 We made these mandatory, so no one can create a plugin that uses an unreasonable amount of memory, or run as root unless they deliberately do so: spec : sidecar : container : resources : requests : cpu : 100m memory : 32Mi limits : cpu : 200m memory : 64Mi securityContext : runAsNonRoot : true runAsUser : 1000 Failure \u00b6 A plugin may fail as follows: Connection/socket error - considered transient. Timeout - considered transient. 404 error - method is not supported by the plugin, as a result the method will not be called again (in the same workflow). 503 error - considered transient. Other 4xx/5xx errors - considered fatal. Transient errors are retried, all other errors are considered fatal. Fatal errors will result in failed steps. Re-Queue \u00b6 It might be the case that the plugin can't finish straight away. E.g. it starts a long running task. When that happens, you return \"Pending\" or \"Running\" a and a re-queue time: { \"node\" : { \"phase\" : \"Running\" , \"message\" : \"Long-running task started\" }, \"requeue\" : \"2m\" } In this example, the task will be re-queued and template.execute will be called again in 2 minutes. Debugging \u00b6 You can find the plugin's log in the agent pod's sidecar, e.g.: kubectl -n argo logs ${ agentPodName } -c hello-executor-plugin Listing Plugins \u00b6 Because plugins are just config maps, you can list them using kubectl : kubectl get cm -l workflows.argoproj.io/configmap-type = ExecutorPlugin Examples and Community Contributed Plugins \u00b6 Plugin directory Publishing Your Plugin \u00b6 If you want to publish and share you plugin (we hope you do!), then submit a pull request to add it to the above directory.","title":"Executor Plugins"},{"location":"executor_plugins/#executor-plugins","text":"Since v3.3","title":"Executor Plugins"},{"location":"executor_plugins/#configuration","text":"Plugins are disabled by default.

We need the following: Plugins enabled (see above). A HTTP server that will be run as a sidecar to the main container and will respond to RPC HTTP requests from the executor with this API contract . A plugin.yaml configuration file, that is turned into a config map so the controller can discover the plugin. A template executor plugin services HTTP POST requests on /api/v1/template.execute : curl http://localhost:4355/api/v1/template.execute -d \\ '{ \"workflow\": { \"metadata\": { \"name\": \"my-wf\" } }, \"template\": { \"name\": \"my-tmpl\", \"inputs\": {}, \"outputs\": {}, \"plugin\": { \"hello\": {} } } }' # ... HTTP/1.1 200 OK { \"node\" : { \"phase\" : \"Succeeded\" , \"message\" : \"Hello template!\" } } Tip: The port number can be anything, but must not conflict with other plugins. Don't use common ports such as 80, 443, 8080, 8081, 8443. If you plan to publish your plugin, choose a random port number under 10,000 and create a PR to add your plugin. If not, use a port number greater than 10,000. We'll need to create a script that starts a HTTP server. Save this as server.py : import json from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler , HTTPServer with open ( \"/var/run/argo/token\" ) as f : token = f . read () . strip () class Plugin ( BaseHTTPRequestHandler ): def args ( self ): return json . loads ( self . rfile . read ( int ( self . headers . get ( 'Content-Length' )))) def reply ( self , reply ): self . send_response ( 200 ) self . end_headers () self . wfile . write ( json . dumps ( reply ) . encode ( \"UTF-8\" )) def forbidden ( self ): self . send_response ( 403 ) self . end_headers () def unsupported ( self ): self . send_response ( 404 ) self . end_headers () def do_POST ( self ): if self . headers . get ( \"Authorization\" ) != \"Bearer \" + token : self . forbidden () elif self . path == '/api/v1/template.execute' : args = self . args () if 'hello' in args [ 'template' ] . get ( 'plugin' , {}): self . reply ( { 'node' : { 'phase' : 'Succeeded' , 'message' : 'Hello template!' , 'outputs' : { 'parameters' : [{ 'name' : 'foo' , 'value' : 'bar' }]}}}) else : self . reply ({}) else : self . unsupported () if __name__ == '__main__' : httpd = HTTPServer (( '' , 4355 ), Plugin ) httpd . serve_forever () Tip : Plugins can be written in any language you can run as a container. Python is convenient because you can embed the script in the container. Some things to note here: You only need to implement the calls you need. Return 404 and it won't be called again. The path is the RPC method name. You should check that the Authorization header contains the same value as /var/run/argo/token . Return 403 if not The request body contains the template's input parameters. The response body may contain the node's result, including the phase (e.g. \"Succeeded\" or \"Failed\") and a message. If the response is {} , then the plugin is saying it cannot execute the plugin template, e.g. it is a Slack plugin, but the template is a Tekton job. If the status code is 404, then the plugin will not be called again. If you save the file as server.* , it will be copied to the sidecar container's args field.

When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted.

Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list. +optional +patchStrategy=merge | | | generateName | string| string | | | GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided.

Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.

Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities. When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized. Before serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that: a. No precision is lost b. No fractional digits will be emitted c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible. The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative. Examples: 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\" Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise. Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.) This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation. +protobuf=true +protobuf.embed=string +protobuf.options.marshal=false +protobuf.options.(gogoproto.goproto_stringer)=false +k8s:deepcopy-gen=true +k8s:openapi-gen=true interface{} QuobyteVolumeSource \u00b6 Quobyte volumes do not support ownership management or SELinux relabeling.

A value of zero is used to terminate a Running workflow affinity Affinity Affinity sets the scheduling constraints for all pods in the io.argoproj.workflow.v1alpha1. Can be overridden by an affinity specified in the template archiveLogs boolean ArchiveLogs indicates if the container logs should be archived arguments Arguments Arguments contain the parameters and artifacts sent to the workflow entrypoint Parameters are referencable globally using the 'workflow' variable prefix. e.g. {{io.argoproj.workflow.v1alpha1.parameters.myparam}} artifactGC WorkflowLevelArtifactGC ArtifactGC describes the strategy to use when deleting artifacts from completed or deleted workflows (applies to all output Artifacts unless Artifact.ArtifactGC is specified, which overrides this) artifactRepositoryRef ArtifactRepositoryRef ArtifactRepositoryRef specifies the configMap name and key containing the artifact repository config. automountServiceAccountToken boolean AutomountServiceAccountToken indicates whether a service account token should be automatically mounted in pods. ServiceAccountName of ExecutorConfig must be specified if this value is false. dnsConfig PodDNSConfig PodDNSConfig defines the DNS parameters of a pod in addition to those generated from DNSPolicy. dnsPolicy string Set DNS policy for the pod. Defaults to \"ClusterFirst\". Valid values are 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet', 'ClusterFirst', 'Default' or 'None'. DNS parameters given in DNSConfig will be merged with the policy selected with DNSPolicy. To have DNS options set along with hostNetwork, you have to specify DNS policy explicitly to 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet'. entrypoint string Entrypoint is a template reference to the starting point of the io.argoproj.workflow.v1alpha1. executor ExecutorConfig Executor holds configurations of executor containers of the io.argoproj.workflow.v1alpha1. hooks LifecycleHook Hooks holds the lifecycle hook which is invoked at lifecycle of step, irrespective of the success, failure, or error status of the primary step hostAliases Array< HostAlias > No description available hostNetwork boolean Host networking requested for this workflow pod. Default to false. imagePullSecrets Array< LocalObjectReference > ImagePullSecrets is a list of references to secrets in the same namespace to use for pulling any images in pods that reference this ServiceAccount. ImagePullSecrets are distinct from Secrets because Secrets can be mounted in the pod, but ImagePullSecrets are only accessed by the kubelet. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod metrics Metrics Metrics are a list of metrics emitted from this Workflow nodeSelector Map< string , string > NodeSelector is a selector which will result in all pods of the workflow to be scheduled on the selected node(s). This is able to be overridden by a nodeSelector specified in the template. onExit string OnExit is a template reference which is invoked at the end of the workflow, irrespective of the success, failure, or error of the primary io.argoproj.workflow.v1alpha1. parallelism integer Parallelism limits the max total parallel pods that can execute at the same time in a workflow podDisruptionBudget PodDisruptionBudgetSpec PodDisruptionBudget holds the number of concurrent disruptions that you allow for Workflow's Pods. Controller will automatically add the selector with workflow name, if selector is empty. Optional: Defaults to empty. podGC PodGC PodGC describes the strategy to use when deleting completed pods podMetadata Metadata PodMetadata defines additional metadata that should be applied to workflow pods ~~ podPriority ~~ ~~ integer ~~ ~~Priority to apply to workflow pods.~~ DEPRECATED: Use PodPriorityClassName instead. podPriorityClassName string PriorityClassName to apply to workflow pods. podSpecPatch string PodSpecPatch holds strategic merge patch to apply against the pod spec. Allows parameterization of container fields which are not strings (e.g. resource limits). priority integer Priority is used if controller is configured to process limited number of workflows in parallel. Workflows with higher priority are processed first. retryStrategy RetryStrategy RetryStrategy for all templates in the io.argoproj.workflow.v1alpha1. schedulerName string Set scheduler name for all pods. Will be overridden if container/script template's scheduler name is set. Default scheduler will be used if neither specified. securityContext PodSecurityContext SecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common container settings. Optional: Defaults to empty. See type description for default values of each field. serviceAccountName string ServiceAccountName is the name of the ServiceAccount to run all pods of the workflow as. shutdown string Shutdown will shutdown the workflow according to its ShutdownStrategy suspend boolean Suspend will suspend the workflow and prevent execution of any future steps in the workflow synchronization Synchronization Synchronization holds synchronization lock configuration for this Workflow templateDefaults Template TemplateDefaults holds default template values that will apply to all templates in the Workflow, unless overridden on the template-level templates Array< Template > Templates is a list of workflow templates used in a workflow tolerations Array< Toleration > Tolerations to apply to workflow pods. ttlStrategy TTLStrategy TTLStrategy limits the lifetime of a Workflow that has finished execution depending on if it Succeeded or Failed. If this struct is set, once the Workflow finishes, it will be deleted after the time to live expires. If this field is unset, the controller config map will hold the default values. volumeClaimGC VolumeClaimGC VolumeClaimGC describes the strategy to use when deleting volumes from completed workflows volumeClaimTemplates Array< PersistentVolumeClaim > VolumeClaimTemplates is a list of claims that containers are allowed to reference. The Workflow controller will create the claims at the beginning of the workflow and delete the claims upon completion of the workflow volumes Array< Volume > Volumes is a list of volumes that can be mounted by containers in a io.argoproj.workflow.v1alpha1. workflowMetadata WorkflowMetadata WorkflowMetadata contains some metadata of the workflow to refer to workflowTemplateRef WorkflowTemplateRef WorkflowTemplateRef holds a reference to a WorkflowTemplate for execution WorkflowStatus \u00b6 WorkflowStatus contains overall status information about a workflow Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description artifactGCStatus ArtGCStatus ArtifactGCStatus maintains the status of Artifact Garbage Collection artifactRepositoryRef ArtifactRepositoryRefStatus ArtifactRepositoryRef is used to cache the repository to use so we do not need to determine it everytime we reconcile. compressedNodes string Compressed and base64 decoded Nodes map conditions Array< Condition > Conditions is a list of conditions the Workflow may have estimatedDuration integer EstimatedDuration in seconds. finishedAt Time Time at which this workflow completed message string A human readable message indicating details about why the workflow is in this condition. nodes NodeStatus Nodes is a mapping between a node ID and the node's status. offloadNodeStatusVersion string Whether on not node status has been offloaded to a database. If exists, then Nodes and CompressedNodes will be empty. This will actually be populated with a hash of the offloaded data. outputs Outputs Outputs captures output values and artifact locations produced by the workflow via global outputs persistentVolumeClaims Array< Volume > PersistentVolumeClaims tracks all PVCs that were created as part of the io.argoproj.workflow.v1alpha1. The contents of this list are drained at the end of the workflow. phase string Phase a simple, high-level summary of where the workflow is in its lifecycle. Will be \"\" (Unknown), \"Pending\", or \"Running\" before the workflow is completed, and \"Succeeded\", \"Failed\" or \"Error\" once the workflow has completed. progress string Progress to completion resourcesDuration Map< integer , int64 > ResourcesDuration is the total for the workflow startedAt Time Time at which this workflow started storedTemplates Template StoredTemplates is a mapping between a template ref and the node's status. storedWorkflowTemplateSpec WorkflowSpec StoredWorkflowSpec stores the WorkflowTemplate spec for future execution. synchronization SynchronizationStatus Synchronization stores the status of synchronization locks CronWorkflowSpec \u00b6 CronWorkflowSpec is the specification of a CronWorkflow Examples with this field (click to open) -

For every invocation of a template, there are nodes which we considered as \"outbound\". Essentially, these are last nodes in the execution sequence to run, before the template is considered completed. These nodes are then connected as parents to a following step. In the case of single pod steps (i.e. container, script, resource templates), this list will be nil since the pod itself is already considered the \"outbound\" node. In the case of DAGs, outbound nodes are the \"target\" tasks (tasks with no children). In the case of steps, outbound nodes are all the containers involved in the last step group. NOTE: since templates are composable, the list of outbound nodes are carried upwards when a DAG/steps template invokes another DAG/steps template. In other words, the outbound nodes of a template, will be a superset of the outbound nodes of its last children. outputs Outputs Outputs captures output parameter values and artifact locations produced by this template invocation phase string Phase a simple, high-level summary of where the node is in its lifecycle. Can be used as a state machine.

Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell env Array< EnvVar > List of environment variables to set in the container. Cannot be updated. envFrom Array< EnvFromSource > List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be updated. image string Container image name. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets. imagePullPolicy string Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images lifecycle Lifecycle Actions that the management system should take in response to container lifecycle events. Cannot be updated. livenessProbe Probe Periodic probe of container liveness. Container will be restarted if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes mirrorVolumeMounts boolean MirrorVolumeMounts will mount the same volumes specified in the main container to the container (including artifacts), at the same mountPaths. This enables dind daemon to partially see the same filesystem as the main container in order to use features such as docker volume binding name string Name of the container specified as a DNS_LABEL. Each container in a pod must have a unique name (DNS_LABEL). Cannot be updated. ports Array< ContainerPort > List of ports to expose from the container. Exposing a port here gives the system additional information about the network connections a container uses, but is primarily informational. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the default \"0.0.0.0\" address inside a container will be accessible from the network. Cannot be updated. readinessProbe Probe Periodic probe of container service readiness. Container will be removed from service endpoints if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes resources ResourceRequirements Compute Resources required by this container. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/ securityContext SecurityContext SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with. If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ startupProbe Probe StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes stdin boolean Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false. stdinOnce boolean Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false terminationMessagePath string Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated. terminationMessagePolicy string Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated. tty boolean Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false. volumeDevices Array< VolumeDevice > volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container. volumeMounts Array< VolumeMount > Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated. workingDir string Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's default will be used, which might be configured in the container image.

If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed.

This cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes stdin boolean Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false. stdinOnce boolean Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false terminationMessagePath string Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated. terminationMessagePolicy string Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated. tty boolean Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false. volumeDevices Array< VolumeDevice > volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container. volumeMounts Array< VolumeMount > Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem.

They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations clusterName string The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request. creationTimestamp Time CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC. Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata deletionGracePeriodSeconds integer Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only. deletionTimestamp Time DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested. Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata finalizers Array< string > Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list. generateName string GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server. If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header). Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency generation integer A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only. labels Map< string , string > Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels managedFields Array< ManagedFieldsEntry > ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like \"ci-cd\". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object. name string Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names namespace string Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the \"default\" namespace, but \"default\" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces ownerReferences Array< OwnerReference > List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller. resourceVersion string An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources. Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency ~~ selfLink ~~ ~~ string ~~ ~~SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.~~ DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release. uid string UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations. Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids Affinity \u00b6 Affinity is a group of affinity scheduling rules. Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description nodeAffinity NodeAffinity Describes node affinity scheduling rules for the pod. podAffinity PodAffinity Describes pod affinity scheduling rules (e.g. co-locate this pod in the same node, zone, etc. as some other pod(s)). podAntiAffinity PodAntiAffinity Describes pod anti-affinity scheduling rules (e.g. avoid putting this pod in the same node, zone, etc. as some other pod(s)). PodDNSConfig \u00b6 PodDNSConfig defines the DNS parameters of a pod in addition to those generated from DNSPolicy. Examples with this field (click to open) - [`dns-config.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/examples/dns-config.yaml) Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description nameservers Array< string > A list of DNS name server IP addresses. This will be appended to the base nameservers generated from DNSPolicy. Duplicated nameservers will be removed. options Array< PodDNSConfigOption > A list of DNS resolver options. This will be merged with the base options generated from DNSPolicy. Duplicated entries will be removed. Resolution options given in Options will override those that appear in the base DNSPolicy. searches Array< string > A list of DNS search domains for host-name lookup. This will be appended to the base search paths generated from DNSPolicy. Duplicated search paths will be removed. HostAlias \u00b6 HostAlias holds the mapping between IP and hostnames that will be injected as an entry in the pod's hosts file. Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description hostnames Array< string > Hostnames for the above IP address. ip string IP address of the host file entry. LocalObjectReference \u00b6 LocalObjectReference contains enough information to let you locate the referenced object inside the same namespace.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names PodDisruptionBudgetSpec \u00b6 PodDisruptionBudgetSpec is a description of a PodDisruptionBudget. Examples with this field (click to open) - [`default-pdb-support.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/examples/default-pdb-support.yaml) Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description maxUnavailable IntOrString An eviction is allowed if at most \"maxUnavailable\" pods selected by \"selector\" are unavailable after the eviction, i.e. even in absence of the evicted pod. For example, one can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying 0. This is a mutually exclusive setting with \"minAvailable\". minAvailable IntOrString An eviction is allowed if at least \"minAvailable\" pods selected by \"selector\" will still be available after the eviction, i.e. even in the absence of the evicted pod. So for example you can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying \"100%\". selector LabelSelector Label query over pods whose evictions are managed by the disruption budget. A null selector will match no pods, while an empty ({}) selector will select all pods within the namespace. PodSecurityContext \u00b6 PodSecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common container settings. Some fields are also present in container.securityContext. Field values of container.securityContext take precedence over field values of PodSecurityContext. Examples with this field (click to open) - [`sidecar-dind.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/examples/sidecar-dind.yaml) Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description fsGroup integer A special supplemental group that applies to all containers in a pod. Some volume types allow the Kubelet to change the ownership of that volume to be owned by the pod: 1. The owning GID will be the FSGroup 2. The setgid bit is set (new files created in the volume will be owned by FSGroup) 3. The permission bits are OR'd with rw-rw---- If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any volume. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. fsGroupChangePolicy string fsGroupChangePolicy defines behavior of changing ownership and permission of the volume before being exposed inside Pod. This field will only apply to volume types which support fsGroup based ownership(and permissions). It will have no effect on ephemeral volume types such as: secret, configmaps and emptydir. Valid values are \"OnRootMismatch\" and \"Always\". If not specified, \"Always\" is used. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. runAsGroup integer The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime default if unset. May also be set in SecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. runAsNonRoot boolean Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in SecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence. runAsUser integer The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in SecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. seLinuxOptions SELinuxOptions The SELinux context to be applied to all containers. If unspecified, the container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each container. May also be set in SecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. seccompProfile SeccompProfile The seccomp options to use by the containers in this pod. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. supplementalGroups Array< integer > A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in addition to the container's primary GID. If unspecified, no groups will be added to any container. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. sysctls Array< Sysctl > Sysctls hold a list of namespaced sysctls used for the pod. Pods with unsupported sysctls (by the container runtime) might fail to launch. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. windowsOptions WindowsSecurityContextOptions The Windows specific settings applied to all containers. If unspecified, the options within a container's SecurityContext will be used. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is linux. Toleration \u00b6 The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches the triple using the matching operator . Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description effect string Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute. Possible enum values: - \"NoExecute\" Evict any already-running pods that do not tolerate the taint. Currently enforced by NodeController. - \"NoSchedule\" Do not allow new pods to schedule onto the node unless they tolerate the taint, but allow all pods submitted to Kubelet without going through the scheduler to start, and allow all already-running pods to continue running. Enforced by the scheduler. - \"PreferNoSchedule\" Like TaintEffectNoSchedule, but the scheduler tries not to schedule new pods onto the node, rather than prohibiting new pods from scheduling onto the node entirely. Enforced by the scheduler. key string Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys. operator string Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category. Possible enum values: - \"Equal\" - \"Exists\" tolerationSeconds integer TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system. value string Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string. PersistentVolumeClaim \u00b6 PersistentVolumeClaim is a user's request for and claim to a persistent volume Examples with this field (click to open) - [`buildkit-template.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/examples/buildkit-template.yaml) - [`ci-output-artifact.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/examples/ci-output-artifact.yaml) - [`ci-workflowtemplate.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/examples/ci-workflowtemplate.yaml) - [`ci.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/examples/ci.yaml) - [`fun-with-gifs.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/examples/fun-with-gifs.yaml) - [`volumes-pvc.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/examples/volumes-pvc.yaml) - [`work-avoidance.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/examples/work-avoidance.yaml) Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description apiVersion string APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#emptydir ephemeral EphemeralVolumeSource Ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver. The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts, and deleted when the pod is removed. Use this if: a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs, b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity tracking are needed, c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more information on the connection between this volume type and PersistentVolumeClaim). Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle of an individual pod. Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for more information. A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and persistent volumes at the same time. fc FCVolumeSource FC represents a Fibre Channel resource that is attached to a kubelet's host machine and then exposed to the pod. flexVolume FlexVolumeSource FlexVolume represents a generic volume resource that is provisioned/attached using an exec based plugin. flocker FlockerVolumeSource Flocker represents a Flocker volume attached to a kubelet's host machine.

Cannot be updated. envFrom Array< EnvFromSource > List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be reported as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be updated. image string Docker image name. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images This field is optional to allow higher level config management to default or override container images in workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets. imagePullPolicy string Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images Possible enum values: - \"Always\" means that kubelet always attempts to pull the latest image. Container will fail If the pull fails. - \"IfNotPresent\" means that kubelet pulls if the image isn't present on disk. Container will fail if the image isn't present and the pull fails. - \"Never\" means that kubelet never pulls an image, but only uses a local image. Container will fail if the image isn't present lifecycle Lifecycle Actions that the management system should take in response to container lifecycle events. Cannot be updated. livenessProbe Probe Periodic probe of container liveness. Container will be restarted if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes name string Name of the container specified as a DNS_LABEL. Each container in a pod must have a unique name (DNS_LABEL). Cannot be updated. ports Array< ContainerPort > List of ports to expose from the container. Exposing a port here gives the system additional information about the network connections a container uses, but is primarily informational. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT prevent that port from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the default \"0.0.0.0\" address inside a container will be accessible from the network. Cannot be updated. readinessProbe Probe Periodic probe of container service readiness. Container will be removed from service endpoints if the probe fails. Cannot be updated.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/ securityContext SecurityContext SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with. If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ startupProbe Probe StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes stdin boolean Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false. stdinOnce boolean Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false terminationMessagePath string Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem. Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated. terminationMessagePolicy string Indicate how the termination message should be populated. File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80 lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated. Possible enum values: - \"FallbackToLogsOnError\" will read the most recent contents of the container logs for the container status message when the container exits with an error and the terminationMessagePath has no contents. - \"File\" is the default behavior and will set the container status message to the contents of the container's terminationMessagePath when the container exits. tty boolean Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to be true. Default is false. volumeDevices Array< VolumeDevice > volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container. volumeMounts Array< VolumeMount > Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated. workingDir string Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's default will be used, which might be configured in the container image.

Must be a C_IDENTIFIER. secretRef SecretEnvSource The Secret to select from Lifecycle \u00b6 Lifecycle describes actions that the management system should take in response to container lifecycle events. For the PostStart and PreStop lifecycle handlers, management of the container blocks until the action is complete, unless the container process fails, in which case the handler is aborted. Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description postStart LifecycleHandler PostStart is called immediately after a container is created. If the handler fails, the container is terminated and restarted according to its restart policy. Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks preStop LifecycleHandler PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure, preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes or until the termination grace period is reached. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks Probe \u00b6 Probe describes a health check to be performed against a container to determine whether it is alive or ready to receive traffic.

Minimum value is 1. successThreshold integer Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed. Defaults to 1. Must be 1 for liveness and startup. Minimum value is 1. tcpSocket TCPSocketAction TCPSocket specifies an action involving a TCP port. terminationGracePeriodSeconds integer Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon probe failure. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate. Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset. timeoutSeconds integer Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults to 1 second. Minimum value is 1.

Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. runAsNonRoot boolean Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in PodSecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence. runAsUser integer The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in PodSecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. seLinuxOptions SELinuxOptions The SELinux context to be applied to the container.

If seccomp options are provided at both the pod & container level, the container options override the pod options. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. windowsOptions WindowsSecurityContextOptions The Windows specific settings applied to all containers. If unspecified, the options from the PodSecurityContext will be used. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is linux. VolumeDevice \u00b6 volumeDevice describes a mapping of a raw block device within a container. Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description devicePath string devicePath is the path inside of the container that the device will be mapped to. name string name must match the name of a persistentVolumeClaim in the pod SecretKeySelector \u00b6 SecretKeySelector selects a key of a Secret. Examples with this field (click to open) - [`artifactory-artifact.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/examples/artifactory-artifact.yaml) - [`input-artifact-git.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/examples/input-artifact-git.yaml) Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description key string The key of the secret to select from. Must be a valid secret key. name string Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names optional boolean Specify whether the Secret or its key must be defined ManagedFieldsEntry \u00b6 ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource that the fieldset applies to. Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description apiVersion string APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is \"group/version\" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted. fieldsType string FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: \"FieldsV1\" fieldsV1 FieldsV1 FieldsV1 holds the first JSON version format as described in the \"FieldsV1\" type. manager string Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields. operation string Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'. subresource string Subresource is the name of the subresource used to update that object, or empty string if the object was updated through the main resource. The value of this field is used to distinguish between managers, even if they share the same name. For example, a status update will be distinct from a regular update using the same manager name. Note that the APIVersion field is not related to the Subresource field and it always corresponds to the version of the main resource. time Time Time is timestamp of when these fields were set. It should always be empty if Operation is 'Apply' OwnerReference \u00b6 OwnerReference contains enough information to let you identify an owning object. An owning object must be in the same namespace as the dependent, or be cluster-scoped, so there is no namespace field. Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description apiVersion string API version of the referent. blockOwnerDeletion boolean If true, AND if the owner has the \"foregroundDeletion\" finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs \"delete\" permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned. controller boolean If true, this reference points to the managing controller. kind string Kind of the referent.

More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names uid string UID of the referent. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids NodeAffinity \u00b6 Node affinity is a group of node affinity scheduling rules. Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution Array< PreferredSchedulingTerm > The scheduler will prefer to schedule pods to nodes that satisfy the affinity expressions specified by this field, but it may choose a node that violates one or more of the expressions. The node that is most preferred is the one with the greatest sum of weights, i.e. for each node that meets all of the scheduling requirements (resource request, requiredDuringScheduling affinity expressions, etc.), compute a sum by iterating through the elements of this field and adding \"weight\" to the sum if the node matches the corresponding matchExpressions; the node(s) with the highest sum are the most preferred. requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution NodeSelector If the affinity requirements specified by this field are not met at scheduling time, the pod will not be scheduled onto the node. If the affinity requirements specified by this field cease to be met at some point during pod execution (e.g. due to an update), the system may or may not try to eventually evict the pod from its node. PodAffinity \u00b6 Pod affinity is a group of inter pod affinity scheduling rules. Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution Array< WeightedPodAffinityTerm > The scheduler will prefer to schedule pods to nodes that satisfy the affinity expressions specified by this field, but it may choose a node that violates one or more of the expressions. The node that is most preferred is the one with the greatest sum of weights, i.e. for each node that meets all of the scheduling requirements (resource request, requiredDuringScheduling affinity expressions, etc.), compute a sum by iterating through the elements of this field and adding \"weight\" to the sum if the node has pods which matches the corresponding podAffinityTerm; the node(s) with the highest sum are the most preferred. requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution Array< PodAffinityTerm > If the affinity requirements specified by this field are not met at scheduling time, the pod will not be scheduled onto the node. If the affinity requirements specified by this field cease to be met at some point during pod execution (e.g. due to a pod label update), the system may or may not try to eventually evict the pod from its node. When there are multiple elements, the lists of nodes corresponding to each podAffinityTerm are intersected, i.e. all terms must be satisfied. PodAntiAffinity \u00b6 Pod anti affinity is a group of inter pod anti affinity scheduling rules. Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution Array< WeightedPodAffinityTerm > The scheduler will prefer to schedule pods to nodes that satisfy the anti-affinity expressions specified by this field, but it may choose a node that violates one or more of the expressions. The node that is most preferred is the one with the greatest sum of weights, i.e. for each node that meets all of the scheduling requirements (resource request, requiredDuringScheduling anti-affinity expressions, etc.), compute a sum by iterating through the elements of this field and adding \"weight\" to the sum if the node has pods which matches the corresponding podAffinityTerm; the node(s) with the highest sum are the most preferred. requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution Array< PodAffinityTerm > If the anti-affinity requirements specified by this field are not met at scheduling time, the pod will not be scheduled onto the node. If the anti-affinity requirements specified by this field cease to be met at some point during pod execution (e.g. due to a pod label update), the system may or may not try to eventually evict the pod from its node. When there are multiple elements, the lists of nodes corresponding to each podAffinityTerm are intersected, i.e. all terms must be satisfied. PodDNSConfigOption \u00b6 PodDNSConfigOption defines DNS resolver options of a pod. Examples with this field (click to open) - [`dns-config.yaml`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/examples/dns-config.yaml) Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description name string Required. value string No description available SELinuxOptions \u00b6 SELinuxOptions are the labels to be applied to the container Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description level string Level is SELinux level label that applies to the container. role string Role is a SELinux role label that applies to the container. type string Type is a SELinux type label that applies to the container. user string User is a SELinux user label that applies to the container. SeccompProfile \u00b6 SeccompProfile defines a pod/container's seccomp profile settings. Only one profile source may be set. Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description localhostProfile string localhostProfile indicates a profile defined in a file on the node should be used. The profile must be preconfigured on the node to work. Must be a descending path, relative to the kubelet's configured seccomp profile location. Must only be set if type is \"Localhost\". type string type indicates which kind of seccomp profile will be applied. Valid options are: Localhost - a profile defined in a file on the node should be used. RuntimeDefault - the container runtime default profile should be used. Unconfined - no profile should be applied. Possible enum values: - \"Localhost\" indicates a profile defined in a file on the node should be used. The file's location relative to /seccomp. - \"RuntimeDefault\" represents the default container runtime seccomp profile. - \"Unconfined\" indicates no seccomp profile is applied (A.K.A. unconfined). Sysctl \u00b6 Sysctl defines a kernel parameter to be set Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description name string Name of a property to set value string Value of a property to set WindowsSecurityContextOptions \u00b6 WindowsSecurityContextOptions contain Windows-specific options and credentials. Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description gmsaCredentialSpec string GMSACredentialSpec is where the GMSA admission webhook (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/windows-gmsa) inlines the contents of the GMSA credential spec named by the GMSACredentialSpecName field. gmsaCredentialSpecName string GMSACredentialSpecName is the name of the GMSA credential spec to use. hostProcess boolean HostProcess determines if a container should be run as a 'Host Process' container. This field is alpha-level and will only be honored by components that enable the WindowsHostProcessContainers feature flag. Setting this field without the feature flag will result in errors when validating the Pod. All of a Pod's containers must have the same effective HostProcess value (it is not allowed to have a mix of HostProcess containers and non-HostProcess containers). In addition, if HostProcess is true then HostNetwork must also be set to true. runAsUserName string The UserName in Windows to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to the user specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in PodSecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1 dataSource TypedLocalObjectReference This field can be used to specify either: * An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot) * An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source, it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source. If the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, this field will always have the same contents as the DataSourceRef field. dataSourceRef TypedLocalObjectReference Specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified. (Alpha) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. resources ResourceRequirements Resources represents the minimum resources the volume should have. If RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature is enabled users are allowed to specify resource requirements that are lower than previous value but must still be higher than capacity recorded in the status field of the claim. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#resources selector LabelSelector A label query over volumes to consider for binding. storageClassName string Name of the StorageClass required by the claim. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#class-1 volumeMode string volumeMode defines what type of volume is required by the claim. Value of Filesystem is implied when not included in claim spec. volumeName string VolumeName is the binding reference to the PersistentVolume backing this claim. PersistentVolumeClaimStatus \u00b6 PersistentVolumeClaimStatus is the current status of a persistent volume claim. Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description accessModes Array< string > AccessModes contains the actual access modes the volume backing the PVC has. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#access-modes-1 allocatedResources Quantity The storage resource within AllocatedResources tracks the capacity allocated to a PVC. It may be larger than the actual capacity when a volume expansion operation is requested. For storage quota, the larger value from allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources is used. If allocatedResources is not set, PVC.spec.resources alone is used for quota calculation. If a volume expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only lowered if there are no expansion operations in progress and if the actual volume capacity is equal or lower than the requested capacity. This is an alpha field and requires enabling RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature. capacity Quantity Represents the actual resources of the underlying volume. conditions Array< PersistentVolumeClaimCondition > Current Condition of persistent volume claim. If underlying persistent volume is being resized then the Condition will be set to 'ResizeStarted'. phase string Phase represents the current phase of PersistentVolumeClaim. Possible enum values: - \"Bound\" used for PersistentVolumeClaims that are bound - \"Lost\" used for PersistentVolumeClaims that lost their underlying PersistentVolume. The claim was bound to a PersistentVolume and this volume does not exist any longer and all data on it was lost. - \"Pending\" used for PersistentVolumeClaims that are not yet bound resizeStatus string ResizeStatus stores status of resize operation. ResizeStatus is not set by default but when expansion is complete resizeStatus is set to empty string by resize controller or kubelet. This is an alpha field and requires enabling RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature. AWSElasticBlockStoreVolumeSource \u00b6 Represents a Persistent Disk resource in AWS.

Fields \u00b6 Field Name Field Type Description volumeClaimTemplate PersistentVolumeClaimTemplate Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume. The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod. The name of the PVC will be <pod name>-<volume name> where <volume name> is the name from the PodSpec.Volumes array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long). An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will not be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

Number must be in the range 1 to 65535. Name must be an IANA_SVC_NAME. Quantity \u00b6 Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors. The serialization format is: ::= (Note that may be empty, from the \"\" case in .) ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 ::= | ::= | . | . | . ::= \"+\" | \"-\" ::= | ::= | | ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html) ::= m | \"\" | k | M | G | T | P | E (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.) ::= \"e\" | \"E\" No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities. When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized. Before serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that: a. No precision is lost b. No fractional digits will be emitted c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible. The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative. Examples: 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\" Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise. Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.) This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

Controller will automatically add the selector with workflow name, if selector is empty. Optional: Defaults to empty. podGC PodGC PodGC describes the strategy to use when deleting completed pods podMetadata Metadata PodMetadata defines additional metadata that should be applied to workflow pods ~~ podPriority ~~ ~~ integer ~~ ~~Priority to apply to workflow pods.~~ DEPRECATED: Use PodPriorityClassName instead. podPriorityClassName string PriorityClassName to apply to workflow pods. podSpecPatch string PodSpecPatch holds strategic merge patch to apply against the pod spec. Allows parameterization of container fields which are not strings (e.g. resource limits). priority integer Priority is used if controller is configured to process limited number of workflows in parallel. Workflows with higher priority are processed first. retryStrategy RetryStrategy RetryStrategy for all templates in the io.argoproj.workflow.v1alpha1. schedulerName string Set scheduler name for all pods. Will be overridden if container/script template's scheduler name is set. Default scheduler will be used if neither specified. securityContext PodSecurityContext SecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common container settings. Optional: Defaults to empty. See type description for default values of each field. serviceAccountName string ServiceAccountName is the name of the ServiceAccount to run all pods of the workflow as. shutdown string Shutdown will shutdown the workflow according to its ShutdownStrategy suspend boolean Suspend will suspend the workflow and prevent execution of any future steps in the workflow synchronization Synchronization Synchronization holds synchronization lock configuration for this Workflow templateDefaults Template TemplateDefaults holds default template values that will apply to all templates in the Workflow, unless overridden on the template-level templates Array< Template > Templates is a list of workflow templates used in a workflow tolerations Array< Toleration > Tolerations to apply to workflow pods. ttlStrategy TTLStrategy TTLStrategy limits the lifetime of a Workflow that has finished execution depending on if it Succeeded or Failed. If this struct is set, once the Workflow finishes, it will be deleted after the time to live expires. If this field is unset, the controller config map will hold the default values. volumeClaimGC VolumeClaimGC VolumeClaimGC describes the strategy to use when deleting volumes from completed workflows volumeClaimTemplates Array< PersistentVolumeClaim > VolumeClaimTemplates is a list of claims that containers are allowed to reference. The Workflow controller will create the claims at the beginning of the workflow and delete the claims upon completion of the workflow volumes Array< Volume > Volumes is a list of volumes that can be mounted by containers in a io.argoproj.workflow.v1alpha1. workflowMetadata WorkflowMetadata WorkflowMetadata contains some metadata of the workflow to refer to workflowTemplateRef WorkflowTemplateRef WorkflowTemplateRef holds a reference to a WorkflowTemplate for execution","title":"Fields"},{"location":"fields/#workflowstatus","text":"WorkflowStatus contains overall status information about a workflow","title":"WorkflowStatus"},{"location":"fields/#fields_4","text":"Field Name Field Type Description artifactGCStatus ArtGCStatus ArtifactGCStatus maintains the status of Artifact Garbage Collection artifactRepositoryRef ArtifactRepositoryRefStatus ArtifactRepositoryRef is used to cache the repository to use so we do not need to determine it everytime we reconcile. compressedNodes string Compressed and base64 decoded Nodes map conditions Array< Condition > Conditions is a list of conditions the Workflow may have estimatedDuration integer EstimatedDuration in seconds. finishedAt Time Time at which this workflow completed message string A human readable message indicating details about why the workflow is in this condition. nodes NodeStatus Nodes is a mapping between a node ID and the node's status. offloadNodeStatusVersion string Whether on not node status has been offloaded to a database. If exists, then Nodes and CompressedNodes will be empty. This will actually be populated with a hash of the offloaded data. outputs Outputs Outputs captures output values and artifact locations produced by the workflow via global outputs persistentVolumeClaims Array< Volume > PersistentVolumeClaims tracks all PVCs that were created as part of the io.argoproj.workflow.v1alpha1. The contents of this list are drained at the end of the workflow. phase string Phase a simple, high-level summary of where the workflow is in its lifecycle.

Default is false. stdinOnce boolean Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.

When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.

They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations clusterName string The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request. creationTimestamp Time CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC. Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata deletionGracePeriodSeconds integer Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only. deletionTimestamp Time DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested. Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata finalizers Array< string > Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list. generateName string GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server. If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header). Applied only if Name is not specified.

This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like \"ci-cd\". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object. name string Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names namespace string Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the \"default\" namespace, but \"default\" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated.

If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected.

There cannot be more than one managing controller. resourceVersion string An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources.

Default is false. stdinOnce boolean Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF.

This bool directly controls if the no_new_privs flag will be set on the container process. AllowPrivilegeEscalation is true always when the container is: 1) run as Privileged 2) has CAP_SYS_ADMIN Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. capabilities Capabilities The capabilities to add/drop when running containers. Defaults to the default set of capabilities granted by the container runtime. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. privileged boolean Run container in privileged mode. Processes in privileged containers are essentially equivalent to root on the host. Defaults to false. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. procMount string procMount denotes the type of proc mount to use for the containers. The default is DefaultProcMount which uses the container runtime defaults for readonly paths and masked paths. This requires the ProcMountType feature flag to be enabled.

Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. runAsNonRoot boolean Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in PodSecurityContext.

If the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, this field will always have the same contents as the DataSourceRef field. dataSourceRef TypedLocalObjectReference Specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.

It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors. The serialization format is: ::= (Note that may be empty, from the \"\" case in .) ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 ::= | ::= | . | . | . ::= \"+\" | \"-\" ::= | ::= | | ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html) ::= m | \"\" | k | M | G | T | P | E (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.) ::= \"e\" | \"E\" No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities. When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized. Before serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that: a. No precision is lost b. No fractional digits will be emitted c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible. The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative. Examples: 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\" Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise. Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.) This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

Furthermore, users can also define their own custom metrics to inform on the state of their Workflows. Custom Prometheus metrics can be defined to be emitted on a Workflow - and Template -level basis. These can be useful for many cases; some examples: Keeping track of the duration of a Workflow or Template over time, and setting an alert if it goes beyond a threshold Keeping track of the number of times a Workflow or Template fails over time Reporting an important internal metric, such as a model training score or an internal error rate Emitting custom metrics with Argo is easy, but it's important to understand what makes a good Prometheus metric and the best way to define metrics in Argo to avoid problems such as cardinality explosion . Metrics and metrics in Argo \u00b6 There are two kinds of metrics emitted by Argo: controller metrics and custom metrics . Controller metrics \u00b6 Metrics that inform on the state of the controller; i.e., they answer the question \"What is the state of the controller right now?\" Default controller metrics can be scraped from service workflow-controller-metrics at the endpoint <host>:9090/metrics Custom metrics \u00b6 Metrics that inform on the state of a Workflow, or a series of Workflows. These custom metrics are defined by the user in the Workflow spec. Emitting custom metrics is the responsibility of the emitter owner. Since the user defines Workflows in Argo, the user is responsible for emitting metrics correctly. What is and isn't a Prometheus metric \u00b6 Prometheus metrics should be thought of as ephemeral data points of running processes; i.e., they are the answer to the question \"What is the state of my system right now ?\". Metrics should report things such as: a counter of the number of times a workflow or steps has failed, or a gauge of workflow duration, or an average of an internal metric such as a model training score or error rate. Metrics are then routinely scraped and stored and -- when they are correctly designed -- they can represent time series. Aggregating the examples above over time could answer useful questions such as: How has the error rate of this workflow or step changed over time? How has the duration of this workflow changed over time? Is the current workflow running for too long? Is our model improving over time? Prometheus metrics should not be thought of as a store of data. Since metrics should only report the state of the system at the current time, they should not be used to report historical data such as: the status of an individual instance of a workflow, or how long a particular instance of a step took to run. Metrics are also ephemeral, meaning there is no guarantee that they will be persisted for any amount of time. If you need a way to view and analyze historical data, consider the workflow archive or reporting to logs. Default Controller Metrics \u00b6 Metrics for the Four Golden Signals are: Latency: argo_workflows_queue_latency Traffic: argo_workflows_count and argo_workflows_queue_depth_count Errors: argo_workflows_count and argo_workflows_error_count Saturation: argo_workflows_workers_busy and argo_workflows_workflow_condition argo_pod_missing \u00b6 Pods were not seen. E.g. by being deleted by Kubernetes. You should only see this under high load. Note This metric's name starts with argo_ not argo_workflows_ . argo_workflows_count \u00b6 Number of workflow in each phase. The Running count does not mean that a workflows pods are running, just that the controller has scheduled them. A workflow can be stuck in Running with pending pods for a long time. argo_workflows_error_count \u00b6 A count of certain errors incurred by the controller. argo_workflows_k8s_request_total \u00b6 Number of API requests sent to the Kubernetes API. argo_workflows_operation_duration_seconds \u00b6 A histogram of durations of operations. argo_workflows_pods_count \u00b6 It is possible for a workflow to start, but no pods be running (e.g. cluster is too busy to run them). This metric sheds light on actual work being done. argo_workflows_queue_adds_count \u00b6 The number of additions to the queue of workflows or cron workflows. argo_workflows_queue_depth_count \u00b6 The depth of the queue of workflows or cron workflows to be processed by the controller. argo_workflows_queue_latency \u00b6 The time workflows or cron workflows spend in the queue waiting to be processed. argo_workflows_workers_busy \u00b6 The number of workers that are busy. argo_workflows_workflow_condition \u00b6 The number of workflow with different conditions. This will tell you the number of workflows with running pods. argo_workflows_workflows_processed_count \u00b6 A count of all Workflow updates processed by the controller. Metric types \u00b6 Please see the Prometheus docs on metric types . How metrics work in Argo \u00b6 In order to analyze the behavior of a workflow over time, we need to be able to link different instances (i.e. individual executions) of a workflow together into a \"series\" for the purposes of emitting metrics. We do so by linking them together with the same metric descriptor. In Prometheus, a metric descriptor is defined as a metric's name and its key-value labels. For example, for a metric tracking the duration of model execution over time, a metric descriptor could be: argo_workflows_model_exec_time{model_name=\"model_a\",phase=\"validation\"} This metric then represents the amount of time that \"Model A\" took to train in the phase \"Validation\". It is important to understand that the metric name and its labels form the descriptor: argo_workflows_model_exec_time{model_name=\"model_b\",phase=\"validation\"} is a different metric (and will track a different \"series\" altogether). Now, whenever we run our first workflow that validates \"Model A\" a metric with the amount of time it took it to do so will be created and emitted. For each subsequent time that this happens, no new metrics will be emitted and the same metric will be updated with the new value. Since, in effect, we are interested on the execution time of \"validation\" of \"Model A\" over time, we are no longer interested in the previous metric and can assume it has already been scraped. In summary, whenever you want to track a particular metric over time, you should use the same metric name and metric labels wherever it is emitted. This is how these metrics are \"linked\" as belonging to the same series. Grafana Dashboard for Argo Controller Metrics \u00b6 Please see the Argo Workflows metrics Grafana dashboard. Defining metrics \u00b6 Metrics are defined in-place on the Workflow/Step/Task where they are emitted from. Metrics are always processed after the Workflow/Step/Task completes, with the exception of real-time metrics . Metric definitions must include a name and a help doc string. They can also include any number of labels (when defining labels avoid cardinality explosion). Metrics with the same name must always use the same exact help string, having different metrics with the same name, but with a different help string will cause an error (this is a Prometheus requirement). All metrics can also be conditionally emitted by defining a when clause. This when clause works the same as elsewhere in a workflow. A metric must also have a type, it can be one of gauge , histogram , and counter ( see below ). Within the metric type a value must be specified. This value can be either a literal value of be an Argo variable . When defining a histogram , buckets must also be provided (see below). Argo variables can be included anywhere in the metric spec, such as in labels , name , help , when , etc. Metric names can only contain alphanumeric characters, _ , and : . Metric Spec \u00b6 In Argo you can define a metric on the Workflow level or on the Template level. Here is an example of a Workflow level Gauge metric that will report the Workflow duration time: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : model-training- spec : entrypoint : steps metrics : prometheus : - name : exec_duration_gauge # Metric name (will be prepended with \"argo_workflows_\") labels : # Labels are optional. Avoid cardinality explosion. - key : name value : model_a help : \"Duration gauge by name\" # A help doc describing your metric. This is required. gauge : # The metric type. Available are \"gauge\", \"histogram\", and \"counter\". value : \"{{workflow.duration}}\" # The value of your metric. It could be an Argo variable (see variables doc) or a literal value ... An example of a Template -level Counter metric that will increase a counter every time the step fails: ... templates : - name : flakey metrics : prometheus : - name : result_counter help : \"Count of step execution by result status\" labels : - key : name value : flakey when : \"{{status}} == Failed\" # Emit the metric conditionally. Works the same as normal \"when\" counter : value : \"1\" # This increments the counter by 1 container : image : python:alpine3.6 command : [ \"python\" , -c ] # fail with a 66% probability args : [ \"import random; import sys; exit_code = random.choice([0, 1, 1]); sys.exit(exit_code)\" ] ... A similar example of such a Counter metric that will increase for every step status ... templates : - name : flakey metrics : prometheus : - name : result_counter help : \"Count of step execution by result status\" labels : - key : name value : flakey - key : status value : \"{{status}}\" # Argo variable in `labels` counter : value : \"1\" container : image : python:alpine3.6 command : [ \"python\" , -c ] # fail with a 66% probability args : [ \"import random; import sys; exit_code = random.choice([0, 1, 1]); sys.exit(exit_code)\" ] ... Finally, an example of a Template -level Histogram metric that tracks an internal value: ... templates : - name : random-int metrics : prometheus : - name : random_int_step_histogram help : \"Value of the int emitted by random-int at step level\" when : \"{{status}} == Succeeded\" # Only emit metric when step succeeds histogram : buckets : # Bins must be defined for histogram metrics - 2.01 # and are part of the metric descriptor. - 4.01 # All metrics in this series MUST have the - 6.01 # same buckets. - 8.01 - 10.01 value : \"{{outputs.parameters.rand-int-value}}\" # References itself for its output (see variables doc) outputs : parameters : - name : rand-int-value globalName : rand-int-value valueFrom : path : /tmp/rand_int.txt container : image : alpine:latest command : [ sh , -c ] args : [ \"RAND_INT=$((1 + RANDOM % 10)); echo $RAND_INT; echo $RAND_INT > /tmp/rand_int.txt\" ] ... Real-Time Metrics \u00b6 Argo supports a limited number of real-time metrics. These metrics are emitted in real-time, beginning when the step execution starts and ending when it completes. Real-time metrics are only available on Gauge type metrics and with a limited number of variables . To define a real-time metric simply add realtime: true to a gauge metric with a valid real-time variable. For example: gauge : realtime : true value : \"{{duration}}\" Metrics endpoint \u00b6 By default, metrics are emitted by the workflow-controller on port 9090 on the /metrics path. By port-forwarding to the pod you can view the metrics in your browser at http://localhost:9090/metrics : kubectl -n argo port-forward deploy/workflow-controller 9090:9090 A metrics service is not installed as part of the default installation so you will need to add one if you wish to use a Prometheus Service Monitor: cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion : v1 kind : Service metadata : labels : app : workflow-controller name : workflow-controller-metrics namespace : argo spec : ports : - name : metrics port : 9090 protocol : TCP targetPort : 9090 selector : app : workflow-controller --- apiVersion : monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind : ServiceMonitor metadata : name : argo-workflows namespace : argo spec : endpoints : - port : metrics selector : matchLabels : app.kubernetes.io/instance : argo-workflows EOF If you have more than one controller pod, using one as a hot-standby , you should use a headless service to ensure that each pod is being scraped so that no metrics are missed.

Metrics should report things such as: a counter of the number of times a workflow or steps has failed, or a gauge of workflow duration, or an average of an internal metric such as a model training score or error rate. Metrics are then routinely scraped and stored and -- when they are correctly designed -- they can represent time series. Aggregating the examples above over time could answer useful questions such as: How has the error rate of this workflow or step changed over time? How has the duration of this workflow changed over time? Is the current workflow running for too long? Is our model improving over time? Prometheus metrics should not be thought of as a store of data. Since metrics should only report the state of the system at the current time, they should not be used to report historical data such as: the status of an individual instance of a workflow, or how long a particular instance of a step took to run. Metrics are also ephemeral, meaning there is no guarantee that they will be persisted for any amount of time.

We do so by linking them together with the same metric descriptor. In Prometheus, a metric descriptor is defined as a metric's name and its key-value labels. For example, for a metric tracking the duration of model execution over time, a metric descriptor could be: argo_workflows_model_exec_time{model_name=\"model_a\",phase=\"validation\"} This metric then represents the amount of time that \"Model A\" took to train in the phase \"Validation\". It is important to understand that the metric name and its labels form the descriptor: argo_workflows_model_exec_time{model_name=\"model_b\",phase=\"validation\"} is a different metric (and will track a different \"series\" altogether). Now, whenever we run our first workflow that validates \"Model A\" a metric with the amount of time it took it to do so will be created and emitted. For each subsequent time that this happens, no new metrics will be emitted and the same metric will be updated with the new value. Since, in effect, we are interested on the execution time of \"validation\" of \"Model A\" over time, we are no longer interested in the previous metric and can assume it has already been scraped. In summary, whenever you want to track a particular metric over time, you should use the same metric name and metric labels wherever it is emitted.

Run The Latest Version \u00b6 You must be running at least v3.1 for several recommendations to work. Upgrade to the very latest patch. Performance fixes often come in patches. Test Your Cluster Before You Install Argo Workflows \u00b6 You'll need a big cluster, with a big Kubernetes master. Users often encounter problems with Kubernetes needing to be configured for the scale. E.g. Kubernetes API server being too small. We recommend you test your cluster to make sure it can run the number of pods they need, even before installing Argo. Create pods at the rate you expect that it'll be created in production. Make sure Kubernetes can keep up with requests to delete pods at the same rate. You'll need to GC data quickly. The less data that Kubernetes and Argo deal with, the less work they need to do. Use pod GC and workflow GC to achieve this. Overwhelmed Kubernetes API \u00b6 Where Argo has a lot of work to do, the Kubernetes API can be overwhelmed.

Git Clone \u00b6 Clone the Git repo into: $GOPATH/src/github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows . Any other path will mean the code generation does not work. Development Container \u00b6 A development container is a running Docker container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. It should be able to do everything you need to do to develop argo workflows using the development container without installing tools on your local machine. It takes quite a long time to build the container. It will run k3d inside the container so you'll have a cluster to use to test against. To communicate with services running either in other development containers or directly on the local developer machine (e.g., a database) the following URL can be used in the workflow spec: host.docker.internal:<PORT> . This facilitates the implementation of workflows, which need to connect to a database or an API server. You can use the development container in a few different ways: Visual Studio Code with Dev Containers extension lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. Open the clone of argo-workflows folder in VS code and it should offer to use the development container automatically. System requirements can be found here . Visual Studio will allow you to forward ports to allow your external browser to access the running components. Dev-container CLI . Install the tool and from the argo-workflow folder do devcontainer up --workspace-folder . followed by devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . /bin/bash to get a shell where you can start building the code. You can use your choice editor outside the docker image to edit code, the changes are mirrored inside the container.

Developing locally \u00b6 To start: The controller, so you can run workflows. MinIO ( http://localhost:9000 , use admin/password) so you can use artifacts: Run: make start Make sure you don't see any errors in your terminal. This runs the Workflow Controller locally on your machine (not in Docker/Kubernetes). You can submit a workflow for testing using kubectl : kubectl create -f examples/hello-world.yaml We recommend running make clean before make start to ensure recompilation.

Argo Workflows has some basic support for Nix which is enough to get Argo Workflows up and running with minimal effort. Here are the steps to follow: Modify the hosts file according to this , don't worry about the other instructions. Set up a kubernetes cluster, k3d is the recommended solution here. Install Nix . Run \"nix develop --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes ./dev/nix/ --impure\" (you can add the extra features as a default in your nix.conf file). Run \"devenv up\". Warning \u00b6 This is still bare-bones at the moment, any feature in the Makefile not mentioned here is excluded for now. In practice this means that only a \"make start UI=true\" equivalent is supported at the moment, as an additional caveat, there are no LDFlags set in the build, as a result the UI will show \"0.0.0-unknown\" for the version. How do I upgrade a dependency? \u00b6 Most dependencies are in the Nix packages repository but if you want a specific version, you might have to build it yourself.

Workflow Controller Security \u00b6 This has three parts. Controller Permissions \u00b6 The controller has permission (via Kubernetes RBAC + its config map) with either all namespaces (cluster-scope install) or a single managed namespace (namespace-install), notably: List/get/update workflows, and cron-workflows. Create/get/delete pods, PVCs, and PDBs. List/get template, config maps, service accounts, and secrets. See workflow controller cluster-role or workflow-controller-role.yaml User Permissions \u00b6 Users minimally need permission to create/read workflows. The controller will then create workflow pods (config maps etc) on behalf of the users, even if the user does not have permission to do this themselves. The controller will only create workflow pods in the workflow's namespace. A way to think of this is that, if the user has permission to create a workflow in a namespace, then it is OK to create pods or anything else for them in that namespace. If the user only has permission to create workflows, then they will be typically unable to configure other necessary resources such as config maps, or view the outcome of their workflow. This is useful when the user is a service. Warning If you allow users to create workflows in the controller's namespace (typically argo ), it may be possible for users to modify the controller itself. In a namespace-install the managed namespace should therefore not be the controller's namespace. You can typically further restrict what a user can do to just being able to submit workflows from templates using the workflow restrictions feature . UI Access \u00b6 If you want a user to have read-only access to the entirety of the Argo UI for their namespace, a sample role for them may look like: apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind : Role metadata : name : ui-user-read-only rules : # k8s standard APIs - apiGroups : - \"\" resources : - events - pods - pods/log verbs : - get - list - watch # Argo APIs. See also https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/manifests/cluster-install/workflow-controller-rbac/workflow-aggregate-roles.yaml#L4 - apiGroups : - argoproj.io resources : - eventsources - sensors - workflows - workfloweventbindings - workflowtemplates - clusterworkflowtemplates - cronworkflows - cronworkflows - workflowtaskresults verbs : - get - list - watch Workflow Pod Permissions \u00b6 Workflow pods run using either: The default service account. The service account declared in the workflow spec. There is no restriction on which service account in a namespace may be used. This service account typically needs permissions . Different service accounts should be used if a workflow pod needs to have elevated permissions, e.g. to create other resources. The main container will have the service account token mounted, allowing the main container to patch pods (among other permissions). Set automountServiceAccountToken to false to prevent this. See fields . By default, workflows pods run as root . To further secure workflow pods, set the workflow pod security context . You should configure the controller with the correct workflow executor for your trade off between security and scalability. These settings can be set by default using workflow defaults . Argo Server Security \u00b6 Argo Server implements security in three layers. Firstly, you should enable transport layer security to ensure your data cannot be read in transit. Secondly, you should enable an authentication mode to ensure that you do not run workflows from unknown users. Finally, you should configure the argo-server role and role binding with the correct permissions. Read-Only \u00b6 You can achieve this by configuring the argo-server role ( example with only read access (i.e. only get / list / watch verbs)). Network Security \u00b6 Argo Workflows requires various levels of network access depending on configuration and the features enabled. The following describes the different workflow components and their network access needs, to help provide guidance on how to configure the argo namespace in a secure manner (e.g. NetworkPolicy ). Argo Server \u00b6 The Argo Server is commonly exposed to end-users to provide users with a UI for visualizing and managing their workflows. It must also be exposed if leveraging webhooks to trigger workflows. Both of these use cases require that the argo-server Service to be exposed for ingress traffic (e.g. with an Ingress object or load balancer). Note that the Argo UI is also available to be accessed by running the server locally (i.e. argo server ) using local KUBECONFIG credentials, and visiting the UI over https://localhost:2746 . The Argo Server additionally has a feature to allow downloading of artifacts through the UI. This feature requires that the argo-server be given egress access to the underlying artifact provider (e.g. S3, GCS, MinIO, Artifactory, Azure Blob Storage) in order to download and stream the artifact. Workflow Controller \u00b6 The workflow-controller Deployment exposes a Prometheus metrics endpoint (workflow-controller-metrics:9090) so that a Prometheus server can periodically scrape for controller level metrics. Since Prometheus is typically running in a separate namespace, the argo namespace should be configured to allow cross-namespace ingress access to the workflow-controller-metrics Service. Database access \u00b6 A persistent store can be configured for either archiving or offloading workflows. If either of these features are enabled, both the workflow-controller and argo-server Deployments will need egress network access to the external database used for archiving/offloading.","title":"Security"},{"location":"security/#security","text":"To report security issues . \ud83d\udca1 Read Practical Argo Workflows Hardening .","title":"Security"},{"location":"security/#workflow-controller-security","text":"This has three parts.","title":"Workflow Controller Security"},{"location":"security/#controller-permissions","text":"The controller has permission (via Kubernetes RBAC + its config map) with either all namespaces (cluster-scope install) or a single managed namespace (namespace-install), notably: List/get/update workflows, and cron-workflows.

Users can create multiple synchronization configurations in the ConfigMap that can be referred to from a workflow or template within a workflow. Alternatively, users can configure a mutex to prevent concurrent execution of templates or workflows using the same mutex. For example: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : my-config data : workflow : \"1\" # Only one workflow can run at given time in particular namespace template : \"2\" # Two instances of template can run at a given time in particular namespace Workflow-level Synchronization \u00b6 Workflow-level synchronization limits parallel execution of the workflow if workflows have the same synchronization reference.

The Workflow \u00b6 The Workflow is the most important resource in Argo and serves two important functions: It defines the workflow to be executed. It stores the state of the workflow. Because of these dual responsibilities, a Workflow should be treated as a \"live\" object. It is not only a static definition, but is also an \"instance\" of said definition. (If it isn't clear what this means, it will be explained below). Workflow Spec \u00b6 The workflow to be executed is defined in the Workflow.spec field. The core structure of a Workflow spec is a list of templates and an entrypoint . templates can be loosely thought of as \"functions\": they define instructions to be executed. The entrypoint field defines what the \"main\" function will be \u2013 that is, the template that will be executed first. Here is an example of a simple Workflow spec with a single template : apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : hello-world- # Name of this Workflow spec : entrypoint : whalesay # Defines \"whalesay\" as the \"main\" template templates : - name : whalesay # Defining the \"whalesay\" template container : image : docker/whalesay command : [ cowsay ] args : [ \"hello world\" ] # This template runs \"cowsay\" in the \"whalesay\" image with arguments \"hello world\" template Types \u00b6 There are 6 types of templates, divided into two different categories. Template Definitions \u00b6 These templates define work to be done, usually in a Container. Container \u00b6 Perhaps the most common template type, it will schedule a Container. The spec of the template is the same as the Kubernetes container spec , so you can define a container here the same way you do anywhere else in Kubernetes. Example: - name : whalesay container : image : docker/whalesay command : [ cowsay ] args : [ \"hello world\" ] Script \u00b6 A convenience wrapper around a container . The spec is the same as a container, but adds the source: field which allows you to define a script in-place. The script will be saved into a file and executed for you. The result of the script is automatically exported into an Argo variable either {{tasks.<NAME>.outputs.result}} or {{steps.<NAME>.outputs.result}} , depending how it was called. Example: - name : gen-random-int script : image : python:alpine3.6 command : [ python ] source : | import random i = random.randint(1, 100) print(i) Resource \u00b6 Performs operations on cluster Resources directly. It can be used to get, create, apply, delete, replace, or patch resources on your cluster. This example creates a ConfigMap resource on the cluster: - name : k8s-owner-reference resource : action : create manifest : | apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: generateName: owned-eg- data: some: value Suspend \u00b6 A suspend template will suspend execution, either for a duration or until it is resumed manually. Suspend templates can be resumed from the CLI (with argo resume ), the API endpoint , or the UI. Example: - name : delay suspend : duration : \"20s\" Template Invocators \u00b6 These templates are used to invoke/call other templates and provide execution control. Steps \u00b6 A steps template allows you to define your tasks in a series of steps. The structure of the template is a \"list of lists\". Outer lists will run sequentially and inner lists will run in parallel. If you want to run inner lists one by one, use the Synchronization feature. You can set a wide array of options to control execution, such as when: clauses to conditionally execute a step . In this example step1 runs first. Once it is completed, step2a and step2b will run in parallel: - name : hello-hello-hello steps : - - name : step1 template : prepare-data - - name : step2a template : run-data-first-half - name : step2b template : run-data-second-half DAG \u00b6 A dag template allows you to define your tasks as a graph of dependencies. In a DAG, you list all your tasks and set which other tasks must complete before a particular task can begin. Tasks without any dependencies will be run immediately. In this example A runs first. Once it is completed, B and C will run in parallel and once they both complete, D will run: - name : diamond dag : tasks : - name : A template : echo - name : B dependencies : [ A ] template : echo - name : C dependencies : [ A ] template : echo - name : D dependencies : [ B , C ] template : echo Architecture \u00b6 If you are interested in Argo's underlying architecture, see Architecture .","title":"Core Concepts"},{"location":"workflow-concepts/#core-concepts","text":"This page serves as an introduction to the core concepts of Argo.","title":"Core Concepts"},{"location":"workflow-concepts/#the-workflow","text":"The Workflow is the most important resource in Argo and serves two important functions: It defines the workflow to be executed.

This allows you to create a library of frequently-used templates and reuse them either by submitting them directly (v2.7 and after) or by referencing them from your Workflows . WorkflowTemplate vs template \u00b6 The terms WorkflowTemplate and template have created an unfortunate naming collision and have created some confusion in the past. However, a quick description should clarify each and their differences. A template (lower-case) is a task within a Workflow or (confusingly) a WorkflowTemplate under the field templates . Whenever you define a Workflow , you must define at least one (but usually more than one) template to run. This template can be of type container , script , dag , steps , resource , or suspend and can be referenced by an entrypoint or by other dag , and step templates. Here is an example of a Workflow with two templates : apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : steps- spec : entrypoint : hello # We reference our first \"template\" here templates : - name : hello # The first \"template\" in this Workflow, it is referenced by \"entrypoint\" steps : # The type of this \"template\" is \"steps\" - - name : hello template : whalesay # We reference our second \"template\" here arguments : parameters : [{ name : message , value : \"hello1\" }] - name : whalesay # The second \"template\" in this Workflow, it is referenced by \"hello\" inputs : parameters : - name : message container : # The type of this \"template\" is \"container\" image : docker/whalesay command : [ cowsay ] args : [ \"{{inputs.parameters.message}}\" ] A WorkflowTemplate is a definition of a Workflow that lives in your cluster. Since it is a definition of a Workflow it also contains templates . These templates can be referenced from within the WorkflowTemplate and from other Workflows and WorkflowTemplates on your cluster. To see how, please see Referencing Other WorkflowTemplates . WorkflowTemplate Spec \u00b6 v2.7 and after In v2.7 and after, all the fields in WorkflowSpec (except for priority that must be configured in a WorkflowSpec itself) are supported for WorkflowTemplates . You can take any existing Workflow you may have and convert it to a WorkflowTemplate by substituting kind: Workflow to kind: WorkflowTemplate . v2.4 \u2013 2.6 WorkflowTemplates in v2.4 - v2.6 are only partial Workflow definitions and only support the templates and arguments field. This would not be a valid WorkflowTemplate in v2.4 - v2.6 (notice entrypoint field): apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : WorkflowTemplate metadata : name : workflow-template-submittable spec : entrypoint : whalesay-template # Fields other than \"arguments\" and \"templates\" not supported in v2.4 - v2.6 arguments : parameters : - name : message value : hello world templates : - name : whalesay-template inputs : parameters : - name : message container : image : docker/whalesay command : [ cowsay ] args : [ \"{{inputs.parameters.message}}\" ] However, this would be a valid WorkflowTemplate : apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : WorkflowTemplate metadata : name : workflow-template-submittable spec : arguments : parameters : - name : message value : hello world templates : - name : whalesay-template inputs : parameters : - name : message container : image : docker/whalesay command : [ cowsay ] args : [ \"{{inputs.parameters.message}}\" ] Adding labels/annotations to Workflows with workflowMetadata \u00b6 2.10.2 and after To automatically add labels and/or annotations to Workflows created from WorkflowTemplates , use workflowMetadata . apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : WorkflowTemplate metadata : name : workflow-template-submittable spec : workflowMetadata : labels : example-label : example-value Working with parameters \u00b6 When working with parameters in a WorkflowTemplate , please note the following: When working with global parameters, you can instantiate your global variables in your Workflow and then directly reference them in your WorkflowTemplate . Below is a working example: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : WorkflowTemplate metadata : name : hello-world-template-global-arg spec : serviceAccountName : argo templates : - name : hello-world container : image : docker/whalesay command : [ cowsay ] args : [ \"{{workflow.parameters.global-parameter}}\" ] --- apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : hello-world-wf-global-arg- spec : serviceAccountName : argo entrypoint : whalesay arguments : parameters : - name : global-parameter value : hello templates : - name : whalesay steps : - - name : hello-world templateRef : name : hello-world-template-global-arg template : hello-world When working with local parameters, the values of local parameters must be supplied at the template definition inside the WorkflowTemplate . Below is a working example: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : WorkflowTemplate metadata : name : hello-world-template-local-arg spec : templates : - name : hello-world inputs : parameters : - name : msg value : \"hello world\" container : image : docker/whalesay command : [ cowsay ] args : [ \"{{inputs.parameters.msg}}\" ] --- apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : hello-world-local-arg- spec : entrypoint : whalesay templates : - name : whalesay steps : - - name : hello-world templateRef : name : hello-world-template-local-arg template : hello-world Referencing other WorkflowTemplates \u00b6 You can reference templates from another WorkflowTemplates (see the difference between the two ) using a templateRef field. Just as how you reference other templates within the same Workflow , you should do so from a steps or dag template. Here is an example from a steps template: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : workflow-template-hello-world- spec : entrypoint : whalesay templates : - name : whalesay steps : # You should only reference external \"templates\" in a \"steps\" or \"dag\" \"template\". - - name : call-whalesay-template templateRef : # You can reference a \"template\" from another \"WorkflowTemplate\" using this field name : workflow-template-1 # This is the name of the \"WorkflowTemplate\" CRD that contains the \"template\" you want template : whalesay-template # This is the name of the \"template\" you want to reference arguments : # You can pass in arguments as normal parameters : - name : message value : \"hello world\" You can also do so similarly with a dag template: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : workflow-template-hello-world- spec : entrypoint : whalesay templates : - name : whalesay dag : tasks : - name : call-whalesay-template templateRef : name : workflow-template-1 template : whalesay-template arguments : parameters : - name : message value : \"hello world\" You should never reference another template directly on a template object (outside of a steps or dag template). This includes both using template and templateRef . This behavior is deprecated, no longer supported, and will be removed in a future version. Here is an example of a deprecated reference that should not be used : apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : workflow-template-hello-world- spec : entrypoint : whalesay templates : - name : whalesay template : # You should NEVER use \"template\" here. Use it under a \"steps\" or \"dag\" template (see above). templateRef : # You should NEVER use \"templateRef\" here. Use it under a \"steps\" or \"dag\" template (see above). name : workflow-template-1 template : whalesay-template arguments : # Arguments here are ignored. Use them under a \"steps\" or \"dag\" template (see above). parameters : - name : message value : \"hello world\" The reasoning for deprecating this behavior is that a template is a \"definition\": it defines inputs and things to be done once instantiated. With this deprecated behavior, the same template object is allowed to be an \"instantiator\": to pass in \"live\" arguments and reference other templates (those other templates may be \"definitions\" or \"instantiators\"). This behavior has been problematic and dangerous. It causes confusion and has design inconsistencies. 2.9 and after Create Workflow from WorkflowTemplate Spec \u00b6 You can create Workflow from WorkflowTemplate spec using workflowTemplateRef . If you pass the arguments to created Workflow , it will be merged with workflow template arguments. Here is an example for referring WorkflowTemplate as Workflow with passing entrypoint and Workflow Arguments to WorkflowTemplate apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : workflow-template-hello-world- spec : entrypoint : whalesay-template arguments : parameters : - name : message value : \"from workflow\" workflowTemplateRef : name : workflow-template-submittable Here is an example of a referring WorkflowTemplate as Workflow and using WorkflowTemplates 's entrypoint and Workflow Arguments apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : workflow-template-hello-world- spec : workflowTemplateRef : name : workflow-template-submittable Managing WorkflowTemplates \u00b6 CLI \u00b6 You can create some example templates as follows: argo template create https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/master/examples/workflow-template/templates.yaml Then submit a workflow using one of those templates: argo submit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/master/examples/workflow-template/hello-world.yaml 2.7 and after Then submit a WorkflowTemplate as a Workflow : argo submit --from workflowtemplate/workflow-template-submittable If you need to submit a WorkflowTemplate as a Workflow with parameters: argo submit --from workflowtemplate/workflow-template-submittable -p param1 = value1 kubectl \u00b6 Using kubectl apply -f and kubectl get wftmpl GitOps via Argo CD \u00b6 WorkflowTemplate resources can be managed with GitOps by using Argo CD UI \u00b6 WorkflowTemplate resources can also be managed by the UI Users can specify options under enum to enable drop-down list selection when submitting WorkflowTemplate s from the UI. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : WorkflowTemplate metadata : name : workflow-template-with-enum-values spec : entrypoint : argosay arguments : parameters : - name : message value : one enum : - one - two - three templates : - name : argosay inputs : parameters : - name : message value : '{{workflow.parameters.message}}' container : name : main image : 'argoproj/argosay:v2' command : - /argosay args : - echo - '{{inputs.parameters.message}}'","title":"Workflow Templates"},{"location":"workflow-templates/#workflow-templates","text":"v2.4 and after","title":"Workflow Templates"},{"location":"workflow-templates/#introduction","text":"WorkflowTemplates are definitions of Workflows that live in your cluster.

Artifacts can be specified for Garbage Collection at different stages: OnWorkflowCompletion , OnWorkflowDeletion , OnWorkflowSuccess , OnWorkflowFailure , or Never Proposal Specifics \u00b6 Workflow Spec changes \u00b6 WorkflowSpec has an ArtifactGC structure, which consists of an ArtifactGCStrategy , as well as the optional designation of a ServiceAccount and Pod metadata (labels and annotations) to be used by the Pod doing the deletion. The ArtifactGCStrategy can be set to OnWorkflowCompletion , OnWorkflowDeletion , OnWorkflowSuccess , OnWorkflowFailure , or Never Artifact has an ArtifactGC section which can be used to override the Workflow level. Workflow Status changes \u00b6 Artifact has a boolean Deleted flag WorkflowStatus.Conditions can be set to ArtifactGCError WorkflowStatus can include a new field ArtGCStatus which holds additional information to keep track of the state of Artifact Garbage Collection. How it will work \u00b6 For each ArtifactGCStrategy the Controller will execute one Pod that runs in the user's namespace and deletes all artifacts pertaining to that strategy. Since OnWorkflowSuccess happens at the same time as OnWorkflowCompletion and OnWorkflowFailure also happens at the same time as OnWorkflowCompletion , we can consider consolidating these GC Strategies together. We will have a new CRD type called ArtifactGCTask and use one or more of them to specify the Artifacts which the GC Pod will read and then write Status to (note individual artifacts have individual statuses). The Controller will read the Status and reflect that in the Workflow Status. The Controller will deem the ArtifactGCTasks ready to read once the Pod has completed (in success or failure). Once the GC Pod has completed and the Workflow status has been persisted, assuming the Pod completed with Success, the Controller can delete the ArtifactGCTasks , which will cause the GC Pod to also get deleted as it will be \"owned\" by the ArtifactGCTasks . The Workflow will have a Finalizer on it to prevent it from being deleted until Artifact GC has occurred. Once all deletions for all GC Strategies have occurred, the Controller will remove the Finalizer. Failures \u00b6 If a deletion fails, the Pod will retry a few times through exponential back off. Note: it will not be considered a failure if the key does not exist - the principal of idempotence will allow this (i.e. if a Pod were to get evicted and then re-run it should be okay if some artifacts were previously deleted). Once it retries a few times, if it didn't succeed, it will end in a \"Failed\" state. The user will manually need to delete the ArtifactGCTasks (which will delete the GC Pod), and remove the Finalizer on the Workflow. The Failure will be reflected in both the Workflow Conditions as well as as a Kubernetes Event (and the Artifacts that failed will have \"Deleted\"=false). Alternatives Considered \u00b6 For reference, these slides were presented to the Argo Contributor meeting on 7/12/22 which go through some of the alternative options that were weighed. These alternatives are explained below: One Pod Per Artifact \u00b6 The POC that was done, which uses just one Pod to delete each Artifact, was considered as an alternative for MVP (Option 1 from the slides). This option has these benefits: simpler in that the Pod doesn't require any additional Object to report status (e.g. ArtifactGCTask ) because it simply succeeds or fails based on its exit code (whereas in Option 2 the Pod needs to report individual failure statuses for each artifact) could have a very minimal Service Account which provides access to just that one artifact's location and these drawbacks: deletion is slower when performed by multiple Pods a Workflow with thousands of artifacts causes thousands of Pods to get executed, which could overwhelm kube-scheduler and kube-apiserver. if we delay the Artifact GC Pods by giving them a lower priority than the Workflow Pods, users will not get their artifacts deleted when they expect and may log bugs Summarizing ADR statement: \"In the context of Artifact Garbage Collection, facing whether to use a separate Pod for every artifact or not, we decided not to, to achieve faster garbage collection and reduced load on K8S, accepting that we will require a new CRD type.\" Service Account/IAM roles \u00b6 We considered some alternatives for how to specify Service Account and/or Annotations, which are applied to give the GC Pod access (slide 12). We will have them specify this information in a new ArtifactGC section of the spec that lives on the Workflow level but can be overridden on the Artifact level (option 3 from slide). Another option considered was to just allow specification on the Workflow level (option 2 from slide) so as to reduce the complexity of the code and reduce the potential number of Pods running, but Option 3 was selected in the end to maximize flexibility. Summarizing ADR statement: \"In the context of Artifact Garbage Collection, facing the question of how users should specify Service Account and annotations, we decided to give them the option to specify them on the Workflow level and/or override them on the Artifact level, to maximize flexibility for user needs, accepting that the code will be more complicated, and sometimes there will be many Pods running.\" MVP vs post-MVP \u00b6 We will start with just S3. We can also make other determinations if it makes sense to postpone some parts for after MVP. Workflow Spec Validation \u00b6 We can reject the Workflow during validation if ArtifactGC is configured along with a non-supported storage engine (for now probably anything besides S3). Documentation \u00b6 Need to clarify certain things in our documentation: Users need to know that if they don't name their artifacts with unique keys, they risk the same key being deleted by one Workflow and created by another at the same time. One recommendation is to parametrize the key, e.g. {{workflow.uid}}/hello.txt . Requirement to specify Service Account or Annotation for ArtifactGC specifically if they are needed (we won't fall back to default Workflow SA/annotations). Also, the Service Account needs to either be bound to the \"agent\" role or otherwise allow the same access to ArtifactGCTasks .","title":"Proposal for Artifact Garbage Collection"},{"location":"proposals/artifact-gc-proposal/#proposal-for-artifact-garbage-collection","text":"","title":"Proposal for Artifact Garbage Collection"},{"location":"proposals/artifact-gc-proposal/#introduction","text":"The motivation for this is to enable users to automatically have certain Artifacts specified to be automatically garbage collected.

Currently the Makefile is unfortunately too opinionated and as a result is often a blocker when first setting up Argo Workflows locally. I believe we should shrink the responsibilities of the Makefile and where possible outsource areas of responsibility to more specialized technology, such as Devenv/Nix in the case of dependency management. Proposal Specifics \u00b6 In order to better address reproducibility, it is better to split up the duties the Makefile currently performs into various sub components, that can be assembled in more appropriate technology. One important aspect here is to completely shift the responsibility of dependency management away from the Makefile and into technology such as Nix or Devenv. This proposal will also enable quicker access to a development build of Argo Workflows to developers, reducing the costs of on-boarding and barrier to entry. Devenv \u00b6 Benefits of Devenv \u00b6 Reproducible build environment Ability to run processes Disadvantages of Devenv \u00b6 Huge learning curve to tap into Nix functionality Less documentation Nix \u00b6 Benefits of Nix \u00b6 Reproducible build environment Direct raw control of various Nix related functionality instead of using Devenv More documentation Disadvantages of Nix \u00b6 Huge learning curve Recommendation \u00b6 I suggest that we use Nix over Devenv. I believe that our build environment is unique enough that we will be tapping into Nix anyway, it probably makes sense to directly use Nix in that case. Proposal \u00b6 In order to maximize the benefit we receive from using something like Nix, I suggest that we initially start off with a modest change to the Makefile. The first proposal would be to remove out all dependency management code and replace this functionality with Nix, where it is trivially possible. This may not be possible for some go lang related binaries we use, we will retain the Makefile functionality in those cases, at least for a while. Eventually we will migrate more and more of this responsibility away from the Makefile. Following Nix being responsible for all dependency management, we could start to consider moving more of our build system itself into Nix, perhaps it is easiest to start off with UI build as it is relatively painless. However, do note that this is not a requirement, I do not see a problem with the Makefile and the Nix file co-existing, it is more about finding a good balance between the reproducibility we desire and the effort we put into obtaining said reproducibility. An example for a replacement could be this dependency for example, note that we do not state any version here, replacing such installations with Nix based installations will ensure that we can ensure that if a build works on a certain developer's machine, it should also work on every other machine as well. What will Nix get us? \u00b6 As mentioned previously Nix gets us closer to reproducible build environments. It should ease significantly the on-boarding process of developers onto the project. There have been several developers who wanted to work on Argo Workflows but found the Makefile to be a barrier, it is likely that there are more developers on this boat. With a reproducible build environment, we hope that everyone who would like to contribute to the project is able to do so easily. It should also save time for engineers on-boarding onto the project, especially if they are using a system that is not Ubuntu or OSX. What will Nix cost us? \u00b6 If we proceed further with Nix, it will require some amount of people working on Argo Workflows to learn it, this is not a trivial task by any means. It will increase the barrier when it comes to changes that are build related, however, this isn't necessarily bad as build related changes should be far less frequent, the friction we will endure here is likely manageable.

Configuring an artifact repository here . When running workflows, it is very common to have steps that generate or consume artifacts. Often, the output artifacts of one step may be used as input artifacts to a subsequent step. The below workflow spec consists of two steps that run in sequence. The first step named generate-artifact will generate an artifact using the whalesay template that will be consumed by the second step named print-message that then consumes the generated artifact. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : artifact-passing- spec : entrypoint : artifact-example templates : - name : artifact-example steps : - - name : generate-artifact template : whalesay - - name : consume-artifact template : print-message arguments : artifacts : # bind message to the hello-art artifact # generated by the generate-artifact step - name : message from : \"{{steps.generate-artifact.outputs.artifacts.hello-art}}\" - name : whalesay container : image : docker/whalesay:latest command : [ sh , -c ] args : [ \"cowsay hello world | tee /tmp/hello_world.txt\" ] outputs : artifacts : # generate hello-art artifact from /tmp/hello_world.txt # artifacts can be directories as well as files - name : hello-art path : /tmp/hello_world.txt - name : print-message inputs : artifacts : # unpack the message input artifact # and put it at /tmp/message - name : message path : /tmp/message container : image : alpine:latest command : [ sh , -c ] args : [ \"cat /tmp/message\" ] The whalesay template uses the cowsay command to generate a file named /tmp/hello-world.txt . It then outputs this file as an artifact named hello-art . In general, the artifact's path may be a directory rather than just a file. The print-message template takes an input artifact named message , unpacks it at the path named /tmp/message and then prints the contents of /tmp/message using the cat command. The artifact-example template passes the hello-art artifact generated as an output of the generate-artifact step as the message input artifact to the print-message step. DAG templates use the tasks prefix to refer to another task, for example {{tasks.generate-artifact.outputs.artifacts.hello-art}} . Optionally, for large artifacts, you can set podSpecPatch in the workflow spec to increase the resource request for the init container and avoid any Out of memory issues. <... snipped ...> - name : large-artifact # below patch gets merged with the actual pod spec and increses the memory # request of the init container. podSpecPatch : | initContainers: - name: init resources: requests: memory: 2Gi cpu: 300m inputs : artifacts : - name : data path : /tmp/large-file container : image : alpine:latest command : [ sh , -c ] args : [ \"cat /tmp/large-file\" ] <... snipped ...> Artifacts are packaged as Tarballs and gzipped by default. You may customize this behavior by specifying an archive strategy, using the archive field.

Artifacts can be deleted OnWorkflowCompletion or OnWorkflowDeletion . You can specify your Garbage Collection strategy on both the Workflow level and the Artifact level, so for example, you may have temporary artifacts that can be deleted right away but a final output that should be persisted: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : artifact-gc- spec : entrypoint : main artifactGC : strategy : OnWorkflowDeletion # default Strategy set here applies to all Artifacts by default templates : - name : main container : image : argoproj/argosay:v2 command : - sh - -c args : - | echo \"can throw this away\" > /tmp/temporary-artifact.txt echo \"keep this\" > /tmp/keep-this.txt outputs : artifacts : - name : temporary-artifact path : /tmp/temporary-artifact.txt s3 : key : temporary-artifact.txt - name : keep-this path : /tmp/keep-this.txt s3 : key : keep-this.txt artifactGC : strategy : Never # optional override for an Artifact Artifact Naming \u00b6 Consider parameterizing your S3 keys by {{workflow.uid}}, etc (as shown in the example above) if there's a possibility that you could have concurrent Workflows of the same spec. This would be to avoid a scenario in which the artifact from one Workflow is being deleted while the same S3 key is being generated for a different Workflow. Service Accounts and Annotations \u00b6 Does your S3 bucket require you to run with a special Service Account or IAM Role Annotation? You can either use the same ones you use for creating artifacts or generate new ones that are specific for deletion permission. Generally users will probably just have a single Service Account or IAM Role to apply to all artifacts for the Workflow, but you can also customize on the artifact level if you need that: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : artifact-gc- spec : entrypoint : main artifactGC : strategy : OnWorkflowDeletion ############################################################################################## # Workflow Level Service Account and Metadata ############################################################################################## serviceAccountName : my-sa podMetadata : annotations : eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn : arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/my-iam-role templates : - name : main container : image : argoproj/argosay:v2 command : - sh - -c args : - | echo \"can throw this away\" > /tmp/temporary-artifact.txt echo \"keep this\" > /tmp/keep-this.txt outputs : artifacts : - name : temporary-artifact path : /tmp/temporary-artifact.txt s3 : key : temporary-artifact-{{workflow.uid}}.txt artifactGC : #################################################################################### # Optional override capability #################################################################################### serviceAccountName : artifact-specific-sa podMetadata : annotations : eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn : arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/artifact-specific-iam-role - name : keep-this path : /tmp/keep-this.txt s3 : key : keep-this-{{workflow.uid}}.txt artifactGC : strategy : Never If you do supply your own Service Account you will need to create a RoleBinding that binds it with a role like this: apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind : Role metadata : annotations : workflows.argoproj.io/description : | This is the minimum recommended permissions needed if you want to use artifact GC. name : artifactgc rules : - apiGroups : - argoproj.io resources : - workflowartifactgctasks verbs : - list - watch - apiGroups : - argoproj.io resources : - workflowartifactgctasks/status verbs : - patch This is the artifactgc role if you installed using one of the quick-start manifest files. If you installed with the install.yaml file for the release then the same permissions are in the argo-cluster-role . If you don't use your own ServiceAccount and are just using default ServiceAccount, then the role needs a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding to default ServiceAccount. What happens if Garbage Collection fails? \u00b6 If deletion of the artifact fails for some reason (other than the Artifact already having been deleted which is not considered a failure), the Workflow's Status will be marked with a new Condition to indicate \"Artifact GC Failure\", a Kubernetes Event will be issued, and the Argo Server UI will also indicate the failure. For additional debugging, the user should find 1 or more Pods named <wfName>-artgc-* and can view the logs. If the user needs to delete the Workflow and its child CRD objects, they will need to patch the Workflow to remove the finalizer preventing the deletion: apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow finalizers : - workflows.argoproj.io/artifact-gc The finalizer can be deleted by doing: kubectl patch workflow my-wf \\ --type json \\ --patch = '[ { \"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/metadata/finalizers\" } ]' Or for simplicity use the Argo CLI argo delete command with flag --force , which under the hood removes the finalizer before performing the deletion. Release Versions >= 3.5 \u00b6 A flag has been added to the Workflow Spec called forceFinalizerRemoval (see here ) to force the finalizer's removal even if Artifact GC fails: spec : artifactGC : strategy : OnWorkflowDeletion forceFinalizerRemoval : true","title":"Artifacts"},{"location":"walk-through/artifacts/#artifacts","text":"Note: You will need to configure an artifact repository to run this example. Configuring an artifact repository here . When running workflows, it is very common to have steps that generate or consume artifacts. Often, the output artifacts of one step may be used as input artifacts to a subsequent step. The below workflow spec consists of two steps that run in sequence. The first step named generate-artifact will generate an artifact using the whalesay template that will be consumed by the second step named print-message that then consumes the generated artifact. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : artifact-passing- spec : entrypoint : artifact-example templates : - name : artifact-example steps : - - name : generate-artifact template : whalesay - - name : consume-artifact template : print-message arguments : artifacts : # bind message to the hello-art artifact # generated by the generate-artifact step - name : message from : \"{{steps.generate-artifact.outputs.artifacts.hello-art}}\" - name : whalesay container : image : docker/whalesay:latest command : [ sh , -c ] args : [ \"cowsay hello world | tee /tmp/hello_world.txt\" ] outputs : artifacts : # generate hello-art artifact from /tmp/hello_world.txt # artifacts can be directories as well as files - name : hello-art path : /tmp/hello_world.txt - name : print-message inputs : artifacts : # unpack the message input artifact # and put it at /tmp/message - name : message path : /tmp/message container : image : alpine:latest command : [ sh , -c ] args : [ \"cat /tmp/message\" ] The whalesay template uses the cowsay command to generate a file named /tmp/hello-world.txt . It then outputs this file as an artifact named hello-art . In general, the artifact's path may be a directory rather than just a file. The print-message template takes an input artifact named message , unpacks it at the path named /tmp/message and then prints the contents of /tmp/message using the cat command. The artifact-example template passes the hello-art artifact generated as an output of the generate-artifact step as the message input artifact to the print-message step. DAG templates use the tasks prefix to refer to another task, for example {{tasks.generate-artifact.outputs.artifacts.hello-art}} . Optionally, for large artifacts, you can set podSpecPatch in the workflow spec to increase the resource request for the init container and avoid any Out of memory issues. <... snipped ...> - name : large-artifact # below patch gets merged with the actual pod spec and increses the memory # request of the init container. podSpecPatch : | initContainers: - name: init resources: requests: memory: 2Gi cpu: 300m inputs : artifacts : - name : data path : /tmp/large-file container : image : alpine:latest command : [ sh , -c ] args : [ \"cat /tmp/large-file\" ] <... snipped ...> Artifacts are packaged as Tarballs and gzipped by default.

Finally, once B and C have completed, step D can run. apiVersion : argoproj.io/v1alpha1 kind : Workflow metadata : generateName : dag-diamond- spec : entrypoint : diamond templates : - name : echo inputs : parameters : - name : message container : image : alpine:3.7 command : [ echo , \"{{inputs.parameters.message}}\" ] - name : diamond dag : tasks : - name : A template : echo arguments : parameters : [{ name : message , value : A }] - name : B dependencies : [ A ] template : echo arguments : parameters : [{ name : message , value : B }] - name : C dependencies : [ A ] template : echo arguments : parameters : [{ name : message , value : C }] - name : D dependencies : [ B , C ] template : echo arguments : parameters : [{ name : message , value : D }] The dependency graph may have multiple roots . The templates called from a DAG or steps template can themselves be DAG or steps templates. This can allow for complex workflows to be split into manageable pieces. The DAG logic has a built-in fail fast feature to stop scheduling new steps, as soon as it detects that one of the DAG nodes is failed. Then it waits until all DAG nodes are completed before failing the DAG itself. The FailFast flag default is true , if set to false , it will allow a DAG to run all branches of the DAG to completion (either success or failure), regardless of the failed outcomes of branches in the DAG.
